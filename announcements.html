 An update to the popular Check Mii <br>
 Out!" Channel is available at no <br>
 charge with several new features <br>
 added:<br>
 <br>
 *In the Posting Plaza, you can now <br>
 easily find all the Miis you ve posted.<br>
 <br>
 *When viewing a Mii Artisan s <br>
 profile, you can now select to see all <br>
 Miis posted by that Artisan.<br>
 <br>
 *If you cancel out of judging a <br>
 contest and return later, any Miis <br>
 you ve selected previously for the <br>
 contest will be retained.<br>
 <br>
 *Parental Controls are now <br>
 supported in the channel. If a user <br>
 chooses to block exchange of user <br>
 generated content from the <br>

 <br>
 *When viewing Miis in the Posting <br>

 popular Miis over the past two <br>
 weeks instead of just 50.<br>
