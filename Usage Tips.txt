Nintendo 3DS Camera Usage Tips:<br>
<br>
Tip #001: Welcome!<br>
<br>
Nintendo 2DS Version:<br>
<br>
Welcome to Nintendo 3DS Camera!<br>
In Nintendo 3DS Camera, you can take 3D and 2D photos and videos.<br>
Please remember that this system can display only 2D images. However, your images are stored on an SD Card...<br>
So even though you can't view photos and videos in 3D on this system, you can transfer the files to a Nintendo 3DS or other compatible device.<br>
Additionally, references to 3D in this application refer to the viewing of photos and videos on a Nintendo 3DS.<br>
When taking photos and videos, try to position the system at least 12 inches from the subject of the shot.<br>
I've got lots more useful information to share about Nintendo 3DS Camera. Just give me a tap at any time to hear some tips!<br>
<br>
Nintendo 3DS Version:<br>
<br>
Welcome to Nintendo 3DS Camera!<br>
In Nintendo 3DS Camera, you can take 3D and 2D photos and videos.<br>
When taking 3D photos and videos and videos, make sure the 3D depth slider is up so you can view them in 3D.<br>
Try to position the system at least 12 inches from the subject of the shot.<br>
I've got lots more useful information to share about Nintendo 3DS Camera. Just give me a tap at any time to hear some tips!<br>
<br>
Tip #002: Reviewing the Usage Tips<br>
<br>
Have you found my little tips and hints useful? I hope so!<br>
You can review any of the tips I've already given you by selecting Usage Tips in Settings.<br>
<br>
Tip #003: Taking a break<br>
<br>
Why not take a short break?<br>
<br>
Tip #004: Closing this software<br>
<br>
Here's a useful hint.<br>
Press the HOME Button at any time to return to the HOME Menu.<br>
<br>
Tip #005: Write-protected SD Card<br>
<br>
Oh!<br>
It looks like your SD Card is write-protected.<br>
In this state, this SD Card can't be used with Nintendo 3DS Camera.<br>
Don't worry, though. All you need to do is to turn the power off and move the write-protection switch to the unlocked position as shown above.<br>
Phew! If only all problems were this easy to solve.<br>
<br>
Tip #006: Photo cameos<br>
<br>
Are you having fun taking 3D photos? Well, let me share something even more fun with you...<br>
Photos in Nintendo 3DS Camera can show up in other games automatically! They might be modified, too. Exciting stuff, eh?<br>
Don't worry, though. Your originals will be kept safe and sound with me. Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #007: Shoot from 12 inches<br>
<br>
Have your 3D shots of objects like toys or teddy bears been turning out well?<br>
If not, you might have the camera positioned too close to he subject.<br>
It's like touching your nose with your finger. Instead of one finger, you see two blurred fingers, right?<br>
The same principle applies when taking shots in Nintendo 3DS Camera.<br>
Try to keep the system at least 12 inches away from the subject for the best results.<br>
<br>
Tip #008: Inner and outer cameras<br>
<br>
The inner canera takes 2D shots.<br>
The outer cameras take shots that can be viewed in both 3D and 2D.<br>
If you want to take a photo of yourself in 3D, use the time function and the outer cameras!<br>
<br>
Tip #009: The red lever<br>
<br>
I bet that red lever down there has piqued your curiosity. Have you tried tapping it yet?<br>
If you tap it, new tools will come into view.<br>
They'll allow you to change the camera mode and adjust the focus,<br>
set a shutter time for photos,<br>
and use speci shooting modes for videos.<br>
Touch the tool lever again to deactivate and hide the tools.<br>
<br>
Tip #010: Adjusting 3D focus<br>
<br>
If other people find it hard to see your 3D photos and videos properly,<br>
use the Circle Pad to adjust the 3D focus.<br>
It will be easier to see shots in 3D if you line up the two seperate images so that they overlap each other.<br>
<br>
Tip #011: 3D focus<br>
<br>
Chirp! Do you have a moment?<br>
3D shots are focused automatically. This is called 3D autofocus.<br>
You can also adjust the 3D focus manually.<br>
Move the left and right until the two images you want to focus on overlap.<br>
To return to 3D autofocus, press X, or use the tool lever to hide the arrows.<br>
That's all I wanted to tell you. Chirp.<br>
<br>
Tip #012: Ideas: People<br>
<br>
You've probably already done this, but taking photos of your friends and family is great fun.<br>
I'm sure they'll enjoy checking your photos of them, too! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #013: Pro: Backgrounds<br>
<br>
If you want to make the subject of your shot stand out, think about the background.<br>
Using simple backgrounds, such as plain walls, will ensure that the subject is the star of your shot.<br>
<br>
Tip #014: Sparkle<br>
<br>
The Sparkle effect is an easy (and glamorous!) way to decorate photos.<br>
Simply aim the camera at a face, blow on the mic, and whoosh! It's like fairyland.<br>
Time your photo carefully, and... Click!<br>
You'll find Sparkle in the Camera Mode menu.<br>
<br>
Tip #015: Photo/video menus<br>
<br>
If you tap an already selected thumbnail (the one with the red border), a small menu will appear.<br>
Using this menu, you can add graffiti to photos and edit videos.<br>
You can also use this menu to delete individual photos and videos.<br>
<br>
Tip #017: The little birdie that can<br>
<br>
I may be a parakeet, but I'm no birdbrain.<br>
I always know when to say the right thing.<br>
Whether you're taking photos and videos or viewing them,<br>
just give me a tap with the stylus to hear what I have to say.<br>
<br>
Tip #018: Tricks: Quick switching<br>
<br>
Did you know you can press Y to switch between taking and viewing photos and videos?<br>
<br>
Tip #019: 3D effect<br>
<br>
Taken a photo or video using the outer cameras, but it's not appearing in 3D?<br>
Check that the 3D depth slider isn't down!<br>
If you still aren't getting 3D images after moving the 3D depth slider up,<br>
3D images may be restricted by Parental Controls. Kids, ask a parent or legal guardian about this. Chirp.<br>
<br>
Tip #020: Ideas: Outdoors<br>
<br>
If you can't think of anything to take a shot of, why not take a walk?<br>
You're sure to find some interesting subjects.<br>
<br>
Tip #021: 3D shots: Near and far<br>
<br>
A road leading into the distance... A tree in the foreground with a building behind it... A hand raised toward the camera...<br>
Capturing objects both near and far in the same scene can make sure a great 3D shot.<br>
<br>
Tip #022: Mystery<br>
<br>
The Mystery effect is...well, mysterious! There's no preview, so you have to take a photo to see what you get.<br>
You can take all kinds of photos with Mystery, and you might make some new discoveries.<br>
They say that some Mystery photos even show things from other dimensions...<br>
<br>
Tip #023: Trivia: The word "camera"<br>
<br>
Here's an interesting bit of trivia for you.<br>
Did you know that the word camera comes from the Latin word for vaulted room? Chirp!<br>
That's odd, don't you think? Why would we use a word that meant "room" for a device that takes photographs?<br>
...<br>
Um... I'll find out and let you know! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #024: View more/fewer shots<br>
<br>
You can change the number of photos or vireos shown on the lower screen by tapping the + or - icons.<br>
<br>
Tip #025: Pro: Neutral shots<br>
<br>
Portraits are all well and good, but why not try taking a shot from an angle, with the subject looking away from the camera?<br>
You might get a more natural, lifelike result.<br>
<br>
Tip #026: Interface Color<br>
<br>
If you feel like a change, select Interface Color in Settings to give Nintendo 3DS Camera a new look.<br>
Not sure which color to go for? Just give the selection cursor a flick and leave it up to luck.<br>
Select Reset to return to the original color.<br>
<br>
Tip #027: 3D shots: Jumble<br>
<br>
Thin objects and groups of differently sized and shaped objects look good in 3D shots.<br>
How neat is your room?<br>
If it's a mess, it might make for a good 3D shot!<br>
Do tidy up, though.<br>
<br>
Tip #028: Merge<br>
<br>
The Merge effect can produce some weird and wonderful photos-and get some funny reactions at your friends...<br>
"I've seen people like this!"<br>
"I think I look good in your hair!"<br>
"Who on earth is that?!"<br>
Me and the other parakeets have had a lot of fun with it. You're sure to have a laugh as well!<br>
<br>
Tip #029: Manual Controls<br>
<br>
Why not try setting up your own original camera effects?<br>
There are four different settings you can change freely in Manual Controls.<br>
You can return the settings to their original values by tapping Reset, so feel free to tinker with them as much as you like!<br>
<br>
Tip #030: Manual Controls + Merge<br>
<br>
You may not realize it, but whenever you use the Merge effect, I'm working hard behind the scenes.<br>
If I can't find any faces, then I can't merge them for you.<br>
If you're taking the photo in a dark place, or use the Negative or Solarize film types in Manual Controls,<br>
it makes it really, really hard for me to make out faces.<br>
I do try my best, though! Just...go easy on me if I make a mistake. I've got eyes like a parakeet, not like a hawk.<br>
<br>
Tip #031: Tricks: Shoot buttons<br>
<br>
You can take photos while choosing the camera mode. Press L, R, or A.<br>
<br>
Tip #032: Attention Sound<br>
<br>
Try using the "bark" or "meow" attention sound when taking shots of your cat or dog.<br>
It might turn to look at the camera at just the right moment for a great snap!<br>
You could also use these sounds to get a smile out of babies and children, or anyone else you're taking a shot of!<br>
<br>
Tip #033: Pro: Different viewpoints<br>
<br>
Images of children or pets taken from a low angle can make for some interesting shots. Try changing your viewpoint, and see what it does for your work!<br>
<br>
Tip #034: Dream<br>
<br>
For a beautiful portrait shot, try using the Dream effect.<br>
Photos taken with this effect have a lovely, soft atmosphere.<br>
Food will also look like it's steaming hot and delicious!<br>
<br>
Tip #035: Film<br>
<br>
Let me tell you about the types of film available in Manual Controls.<br>
Each film type gives your shots a different atmosphere.<br>
Try using the B/W film. It's like stepping onto the set of a silent movie!<br>
<br>
Tip #036: Pro: Camera shake<br>
<br>
Do you ever find your photos and videos turn out rather blurry?<br>
If your hands move while you're taking a shot, it'll cause that blurring effect. This is what's known as camera shake.<br>
Incidentally, photos are much more likely to suffer from camera shake when shooting in dark places.<br>
When doing so, try to hold the system as steadily as you can, or place it on a steady surface.<br>
<br>
Tip #037: Thumbnail border colors<br>
<br>
Thumbnails for photos saved to the System Memory have dark borders,<br>
and thumbnails for photos saved to the SD Card have light borders.<br>
Is there anything I don't know?<br>
<br>
Tip #038: Trivia: Dark rooms<br>
<br>
I found out why we use camera, a word that means room in Latin, to refer to a device that is used for taking photographs.<br>
Many years ago, people discovered that if you make a small hole in the wall of a completely darkened room,<br>
sunlight shining through the hole projects an image of the view outside onto the opposite wall!<br>
Camera is the short form of the phrase camera obscura, which means "darkened room."<br>
What? Rooms are too big to carry around and take photos with?<br>
...<br>
Let me get back to you again on how they got from a room to a pocket-sized camera... Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #039: Removing the SD Card<br>
<br>
Turn off your Nintendo 3DS system before removing the SD Card.<br>
Open the slot cover and push the SD Card in until it clicks.<br>
Then, remove the SD Card by pulling the part sticking out of the slot.<br>
When inserting an SD Card, make sure that the connectors are facing up.<br>
<br>
Tip #040: Pro: Keep snapping!<br>
<br>
Even the pros don't always get the shot they want on the first try. They take lots of shots and choose the best one.<br>
One of the keys to getting a good shot is just to take as many as you can!<br>
You can always just delete the bad shots and keep the good ones. You might even end up with a great shot you didn't mean to take!<br>
So if you're not sure of the right timing to take a shot, just snap, snap, snap, and sort them out later!<br>
<br>
Tip #041: Viewing slide shows<br>
<br>
Slide shows are a fun way of viewing and sharing your photos and videos.<br>
If you're going to put the system down or view the slide show from a distance (or if several people will be viewing it). I recommend that you view it in 2D.<br>
To view it in 2D, move the 3D depth slider down.<br>
<br>
Tip #042: Slide show: Themes<br>
<br>
You can choose different themes for slide shows.<br>
I'll do the legwork for you and pick out the right shots for each theme.<br>
If the shots I pick don't quite match the theme, well... I do try my best.<br>
Sorry. Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #043: Photo Save Location<br>
<br>
Photos taken with Nintendo 3DS Camera<br>
can be saved to the System Memory or an SD Card.<br>
You can store a maximum of about 380 photos to the System Memory,<br>
and a maximum of about 3,000 photos and videos to an SD Card.<br>
Select Photo Save Location in Settings to select where to save photos.<br>
<br>
Tip #044: JPG and MPO files<br>
<br>
Photos saved to the SD Card can be found in the DCIM folder.<br>
There are two different file formats used for photos taken with Nintendo 3DS Camera.<br>
Files whose names look like HNI_XXX.JPG are 2D photos.<br>
Files whose names look like HNI_XXX.MPO are 3D photos.<br>
The other day, a friend of mine accidentally deleted an MPO file.<br>
The 3D data was lost, so the photo could be viewed only in 2D. He was pretty upset about it.<br>
Learn from my...I mean, my friend's...mistake! Be careful not to delete important files! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #045: Ideas: Animals<br>
<br>
Why not try taking shots of dogs in town or pigeons in the park?<br>
With a photo, you can add graffiti to express what the dog's thinking... Why, you might be able to make up a little story about it.<br>
"Ruff! Now where did I put that bone?"<br>
<br>
Tip #046: 3D shots: Framing<br>
<br>
To ensure the best 3D effect, frame the subject of your shot so that it fits fully within the frame without being cropped.<br>
<br>
Tip #047: Viewing 3D shots<br>
<br>
Have you ever tried to take a photo or video in 3D and discovered later that the 3D slider was all the way down?<br>
Don't worry! You can still view your shots in 3D by moving the 3D depth slider up.<br>
Of course, any photos you take with the inner camera will remain in 2D no matter what. Use the outer cameras to take 3D shots.<br>
<br>
Tip #048: The 3D icon<br>
<br>
A 3D icon is displayed on the upper screen while an image that can be shown in 3D is on the screen.<br>
If the icon is white, the image is being displayed in 3D.<br>
If the icon is gray, the image is being displayed in 2D.<br>
<br>
Tip #049: Timer<br>
<br>
Want to get in the frame for a group shot?<br>
Try using the timer feature.<br>
You can set a countdown, after which the system will shoot for you.<br>
You can also use the voice-activation function to take a shot when you say "OK!"<br>
Remember to say it loud and clear! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #050: Pro: Avoid camera shake<br>
<br>
Ever had the camera move ever so slightly right when you press the Shoot buttons?<br>
The timer is pretty helpful for times when it's easy to get camera shake as you take a photo, like when shooting in dark rooms.<br>
Just set the timer, then hold the system firmly in your hands.<br>
You won't have to press the Shoot buttons this way, which could help prevent movement that causes camera shake.<br>
<br>
Tip #051: Low Light<br>
<br>
The Low Light effect can help you when taking shots at night or in darker rooms.<br>
It increases the exposure time slightly in order to capture more light,<br>
so, to avoid camera shake, make sure you hold the camera firmly when shooting!<br>
<br>
Tip #052: 3D autofocus<br>
<br>
3D autofocus is where I take care of focusing the image for you, behind the scenes.<br>
The thing is, sometimes I can't tell what to focus on. For example, photos taken in dark places are difficult for me to work with. Chirp...<br>
If you find that the image on the upper screen isn't appearing properly in 3D,<br>
help me by adjusting the 3D focus yourself.<br>
Just touch the red tool level to display the adjustment icon.<br>
I'll still try to help as much as possible, but sometimes, I'll need you to do your part. What a great photo-taking team we'll make! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #053: Slide shows<br>
<br>
Slide shows are more fun if you choose music that suits your visuals.<br>
You can choose from a variety of different music tracks in the slide-show settings.<br>
You can also set the photo-display duration and transition effect.<br>
<br>
Tip #054: Trivia: Portable cameras<br>
<br>
I've been looking into the development of cameras from darkened rooms to the handheld devices we use today.<br>
It seems some very clever people figured out how to use lenses and mirrors to reproduce the darkened-room effect in a small box!<br>
Awfully clever, don't you think? I hope that answers your questions.<br>
Oh, hang on... A small box? But then how would we fit in there to actually see the picture?<br>
...<br>
Hm. Looks like I've got a little research left to do.<br>
<br>
Tip #055: Ideas: Flowers<br>
<br>
Have you tried taking shots of flowers or plants?<br>
You could try taking a shot of the same flower every day to record its growth.<br>
<br>
Tip #056: Pro: Backlight<br>
<br>
A light source facing toward the camera is known as a backlight.<br>
Taking a photo with a backlight will make the subject look darker.<br>
This is undesirable in some situations but can also be used to create an interesting silhouette effect.<br>
<br>
Tip #057: 3D shots: Transparency<br>
<br>
Fences, windows, and other things you can see through make for interesting 3D shots.<br>
<br>
Tip #058: Brightness + Dream<br>
<br>
Manual Controls can be used to give Camera Mode effects a little more "oomph."<br>
For example, try turning on the Dream effect amd moving the Brightness slider to the right.<br>
You'll get a bright, blissful photo!<br>
<br>
Tip #059: Contrast<br>
<br>
Have you tried adjusting the Contrast setting in Manual Controls?<br>
The setting lets you adjust the range of colors.<br>
Move the slider to the left for a calmer range of colors.<br>
Move the slider to the right for a brighter and more vivid range of colors.<br>
When taking shots at special events and parties, try using a vivid contrast setting!<br>
<br>
Tip #060: Ideas: Sky<br>
<br>
Why not try taking a shot of the sky?<br>
You might think you see the same sky every day, but every day gives it a new look.<br>
Blue skies, like the sea... Floating, fluffy clouds... Passing airplanes...<br>
(Don't take shots of the sun, though!<br>
<br>
Tip #061: 3D shots: Haze<br>
<br>
Even hazy bodies like steam or smoke can look good in 3D shots.<br>
Just be careful that you don't get too close to anything hot!<br>
<br>
Tip #062: Displaying the level<br>
<br>
Press Down to display a level on the 3D Screen.<br>
Press Down again to hide it.<br>
You can also calibrate the red horizontal level in order to change its angle.<br>
Place the system on a surface sloped to the angle that you wish to use for the level, then hold Up.<br>
To return the baseline to normal, place the system on a table or other flat surface, then hold Up.<br>
<br>
Tip #063: Try using the level!<br>
<br>
Need help keeping trees, buildings, and the like lined up straight in your shots? Press Down to display a handy level.<br>
The red horizon line tilts as you tilt the system. It's roughly parallel with the ground.<br>
The static white crosshairs indicate the center of the shot.<br>
Use these to help you shoot straight!<br>
<br>
Tip #064: About the Merge effect<br>
<br>
You don't have to take photos of actual people when merging faces.<br>
Try merging your face with people in posters, photos, or even with mannequins!<br>
<br>
Tip #065: Trivia: The first photos<br>
<br>
OK. OK. I've finally sorted it all out. When you have a portable camera, you need a way for people to see the image being projected inside the camera, right?<br>
Well, I'll skip the technical bits, but basically, the image is burned onto a strip of film inside the box that can be developed to produce a photograph!<br>
Ah, the power of science!<br>
I'm not fielding any more questions on this subject. Chirp.<br>
(Feel free to do your own research into the subject, though! We've barely even scratched the surface!)<br>
<br>
Tip #066: Ideas: Food<br>
<br>
Why not try taking a shot of today's dinner?<br>
You could even take shots of your meals every day to keep a diary of what you eat.<br>
<br>
Tip #067: About the Sparkle effect<br>
<br>
If you tilt the system while using the Sparkle effect. you can change the way the sparkles move.<br>
<br>
Tip #068: Grouping shots<br>
<br>
Version 1<br>
<br>
Do you have so many photos and videos that it takes a while to scroll through them?<br>
Tap a date folder to select it, and then tap again to collapse all shots from that date into the folder, making scrolling easier.<br>
Tap the collapsed folder if you want to see all of the shots again.<br>
I went to a seed festival yesterday, but I'm not showing you the photos. Chirp.<br>
<br>
Version 2<br>
<br>
Do you have so many photos and videos that it takes a while to scroll through them?<br>
Tap a date folder to select it, and then tap again to collapse all shots from that date into the folder, making scrolling easier.<br>
Tap the collapsed folder if you want to see all of the shots again.<br>
I went to a seed festival yesterday. Would you like to see the photos? No? Too seedy for you? Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #069: Keep practicing!<br>
<br>
Be sure to take a good look at your photos and videos once you take them.<br>
Looking over the results can help you improve your technique.<br>
You may even find inspiration!<br>
<br>
Tip #070: Pro: Balance<br>
<br>
Taking a shot of an object so that it appears right in the middle of the screen can give your work some real impact.<br>
Alternatively, taking a shot so that it's slightly off center can give it a kind of cool look as well.<br>
Press Down to display the level. It'll help you find the center of the screen.<br>
Keeping the center of the screen in mind can help you balance the composition of your shots.<br>
<br>
Tip #071: Sharpness<br>
<br>
Have you tried adjusting the Sharpness setting in Manual Controls?<br>
The setting lets you adjust how sharp the focus is.<br>
Move the slider to the left, and you'll get a soft focus.<br>
Move it to the right, and the focus will get sharper and sharper.<br>
Using a softer focus can be a handy trick for taking more flattening shots of people.<br>
<br>
Tip #072: 3D shots: Vertical lines<br>
<br>
Including vertical lines, such as doors or pillars, in your 3D shots will enhance the 3D effect.<br>
<br>
Tip #073: Sepia + Sparkle<br>
<br>
Try combining different settings in Camera Mode and Manual Controls.<br>
For example, if you try combining Sepia film with the Sparkle effect...<br>
the Sparkle effect you know and love will come to be even more magical.<br>
<br>
Tip #074: Pinhole<br>
<br>
You can use the Pinhole effect to give your photos an old-fashioned, nostalgic look.<br>
Why not try using it to take a photo of a beloved old toy before you pass it on?<br>
<br>
Tip #075: Brightness<br>
<br>
Have you tried adjusting the Brightness setting in Manual Controls?<br>
This setting lets you adjust the... Well, it lets you adjust the brightness of the shot. Chirp.<br>
Move the slider to the left to go darker;<br>
move it to the right to go brighter.<br>
Master the settings in Manual Controls, and you may learn to take shots exactly the way you want them.<br>
<br>
Tip #076: Pro: Viewpoint<br>
<br>
When taking shots of people, keep your viewpoint in mind.<br>
For example, if you have a person facing right on the right-hand side of the shot, it'll look a bit cramped.<br>
If you put them on the left-hand side of the slide, they'll fit in a bit more comfortably.<br>
And for people facing left, the opposite applies. Put them on the right slide.<br>
Balancing different things in the shot like this is called composition.<br>
<br>
Tip #077: B/W + Merge<br>
<br>
Try changing the Film setting in Manual Controls to B/W and combining it with the Merge effect...<br>
Ta-da! You've got a photo of a famous figure right out of a history book!<br>
(...But just who is it supposed to be a photo of, though?)<br>
<br>
Tip #078: Ideas: After the rain<br>
<br>
Have you ever taken shots just after the rain stops?<br>
It's a chance to take shots that you can't take when the weather's dry.<br>
For instance, how about shooting a scene reflected in a puddle?<br>
<br>
Tip #079: Contrast + Pinhole<br>
<br>
You know which Manual Controls setting I like to combine with the Pinhole effect?<br>
Contrast. Simply move the slider all the way to the right...<br>
and it's just like using a toy camera!<br>
<br>
Tip #080: Pro: Angles<br>
<br>
There are many differrmt ways to take portraits, depending on how you want to present the subject. For example...<br>
Shoot from a low angle looking upward at the subject for a cool shot, like something from a fashion magazine.<br>
Shoot from above with the subject looking up at you to increase the cuteness factor.<br>
Even with the same subject and setting, the results can change dramatically when you use different angles.<br>
<br>
Tip #081: Trivia: A strange dream<br>
<br>
I heard a story about someone living a long time ago who had a very strange dream.<br>
The person dreamed of a man holding a small box with a lens on the front who drew a picture that looked just like the person dreaming all of this.<br>
This all happened way before the invention of the camera.<br>
Isn't that a strange story?<br>
<br>
Tip #082: Ideas: Favorites<br>
<br>
You'll always enjoy looking at shots of things you like or enjoy.<br>
Your favorite people, places, belongings... Show how much you like them by takng shots of them!<br>
<br>
Tip #083: Video save location<br>
<br>
Videos you shoot with Nintendo 3DS Camera are always saved to the SD Card. They can't be saved to the System Memory.<br>
So, as you might expect, the Photo Save Location setting is for photos only. It won't affect where your videos are saved. Keep that in mind. Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #084: Switching cameras<br>
<br>
You've probably worked this out by now, but you can use Nintendo 3DS Camera to take both photos and videos!<br>
When you want to shoot a video, just tap the Video icon.<br>
When you want to swap from shooting videos to taking photos, tap the Photo icon to switch modes.<br>
<br>
Tip #085: 3D shots: Videos<br>
<br>
Videos that contain a lot of movement might be difficult to see in 3D or might make you feel a bit dizzy to watch.<br>
If you move the system around when you're filming, it's better to do so slowly.<br>
<br>
Tip #086: Special shooting modes<br>
<br>
You can shoot some unusual videos using the special shooting modes.<br>
Interval, Stop Motion, and Montage are all worth a try...<br>
Each one lets you do something different, and they're all easy to use.<br>
Oh, just one thing: none of these modes allows you to record sound with your video.<br>
<br>
Tip #087: Stop Motion<br>
<br>
With Stop Motion, you can shoot simple animated videos.<br>
For instance, you could take a handy nearby object, like a pen,<br>
and shoot it while moving it ever so slightly between frames.<br>
The resulting video will have a charming staccato quality that I, for one, am a huge fan of!<br>
<br>
Tip #088: Interval<br>
<br>
Interval shoots individual frames at set intervals, then puts them together into a single video.<br>
This is an easy way to create videos in which it looks as though time has sped up.<br>
Try shooting something that normally moves slowly, and you might end up seeing it in a totally different way!<br>
<br>
Tip #089: Montage<br>
<br>
Montage allows you to pause recording.<br>
You can use this mode to shoot a single video that includes a variety of different scenes.<br>
Just pause recording, pick your new scene, and then unpause to start recording again!<br>
<br>
Tip #090: Watching videos<br>
<br>
Video thumbnails have borders that are a bit different from the borders used for photos.<br>
Touch the thumbnail for a video, and it will play on the upper screen.<br>
That way you'll remember in no time what kind of video it was that you shot. Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #091: Something different<br>
<br>
Have you been making good use of the special shooting modes?<br>
Use them to take totally different kinds of videos from normal. It's really quite good fun! Chirp!<br>
To find the special shooting modes, just tap the red lever at the bottom of the screen.<br>
<br>
Tip #092: Ideas: Dancing dolls<br>
<br>
You can make dolls dance by using Stop Motion.<br>
Pose them and move them little by little while taking a frame at a time.<br>
It's so exciting to imagine how the finished video will look as you make fine adjustments!<br>
<br>
Tip #093: Tricks: Afterimages<br>
<br>
Have you noticed a kind of afterimage appearing when you film using the special shooting modes?<br>
With Interval and Stop Motion, this image shows you the last frame that was shot.<br>
With Montage, this inage shows you the frame at which you paused the recording.<br>
These images help you make sure that your next shot in the sequence lines up with your last one!<br>
<br>
Tip #094: Ideas: Clouds<br>
<br>
Try using Interval to film clouds as they drift across the sky.<br>
Set the interval to five seconds, and you'll be able to capture the motion of the clouds really well.<br>
Set a longer interval than that for dramatic scenes where the clouds seem to whizz past!<br>
<br>
Tip #095: Pro: Blown-out highlights<br>
<br>
Do you ever find that clouds up in the sky are too bright in your photos and videos to show much detail?<br>
In photography, this phenomenon is known as a blown-out highlight.<br>
Move the Brightness slider in Manual Controls to the left to compensate for this.<br>
That should help bring out detail when you're shooting bright things like clouds!<br>
<br>
Tip #096: Ideas: Transformation<br>
<br>
Have you given Montage a try yet?<br>
I got my cousin to help me, and we made a video in which I change into a superhero!<br>
It's easier than it sounds! Montage lets us pause the recording, I put on my costume, then we started filming again!<br>
You should have seen me in my cape. I looked so heroic! Chirp.<br>
<br>
Tip #097: Editing videos<br>
<br>
With the Edit Video tools, you can do a lot of really neat things with your videos as you play them.<br>
You can change the playback speed and pitch, for example.<br>
The horizontal axis controls the speed at which the video is played,<br>
while the vertical axis controls the pitch of the sound.<br>
You can even play your videos backward! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #098: Ideas: Plant growth<br>
<br>
Wouldn't it be great to be able to watch a flower as it starts to bloom, or a new shoot emerging from the ground?<br>
If you set the interval to 60 seconds in Interval and film flowers and plants,<br>
you'll be able to watch their growth sped up! You can record up to about eight days of footage this way.<br>
Not a bad idea for budding filmmakers. Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #099: Slide-show media types<br>
<br>
If you want a slide show to skip videos and only show photos,<br>
select Media Type in the Select Theme menu and choose the Photos Only option.<br>
<br>
Tip #100: Stop Motion + B/W<br>
<br>
Be sure to try applying different camera settings to the three special shooting modes. You can get some very interesting results!<br>
For example, if you use Stop Motion and film in black and white,<br>
you can create a video that looks just like an old silent movie.<br>
How dramatic! Chirp.<br>
<br>
Tip #101: Ideas: People watching<br>
<br>
Here's a fun idea: set your Nintendo 3DS system up over a view of a busy stret junction,<br>
then shoot an Interval video with the interval set to two seconds.<br>
Watching the people and cars rush by has a certain epic quality to it, doesn't it?<br>
Oh, the busy pace of modern life! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #102: Tricks: Frame by frame<br>
<br>
Spot something in a video that only appears for a second? Take a proper look by using Edit Video.<br>
Just pause the video after you see something you want to check out, then press L to back up a frame at a time.<br>
If you go too far back, just press R to advance a frame at a time.<br>
<br>
Tip #103: Saving frames<br>
<br>
The Save Frame option in the Edit Video menu allows you to pick out single frames from your videos.<br>
Tap Save Frame when a video is paused to save the image on the upper screen as a photo.<br>
That way you'll able to save those crucial moments and view them to your heart's content!<br>
<br>
Tip #104: Tricks: Interval animation<br>
<br>
Do you find that shooting in Stop Motion is fun, but it's too bothersome for your liking?<br>
If so, then you might prefer Interval, which takes the individual shots you're going to string together automatically!<br>
Prop your Nintendo 3DS system up so it will shoot the right area, then start filming, and you can have both hands free to shift objets between shots!<br>
Once you get the hang of it, set the interval to two seconds for a very speedy shooting session!<br>
<br>
Tip #105: Ideas: Construction<br>
<br>
Building models is fun, isn't it?<br>
You know what's even more fun? Shooting the model-building process using Interval or Stop Motion!<br>
Watching yourself progress from a pile of pieces to a finished model makes you realize how rewarding model building is!<br>
<br>
Tip #106: Visible area of photos<br>
<br>
A photo you've taken with Nintendo 3DS Camera is actually bigger than what's visible on screen.<br>
To see the whole thing, slide the Circle Pad down.<br>
To return to normal view, slide the Circle Pad up.<br>
<br>
Tip #107: Nintendo DSi software<br>
<br>
Some Nintendo DSi software titles use photos saved to the System Memory.<br>
There are some photos that they can't use though, like ones with graffiti drawn on them.<br>
<br>
Tip #108: Ideas: Teleportation<br>
<br>
Psst... Want to know the secret of teleportation?<br>
Put a cup on a table and start shooting a video in Montage mode.<br>
Shoot the cup sitting on the table for a couple of minutes, then pause, move the cup, and resume filming.<br>
Ta-da!<br>
It's magic! Real magic! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #109: AVI files<br>
<br>
Videos saved to the SD Card can be found in its DCIM folder.<br>
Files with names like HNI_XXXX.AVI are videos.<br>
Please don't try to play 3D videos on devices that don't support 3D playback.<br>
It won't work! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #110: "The Noble Parakeet"<br>
<br>
Allow me to express my gratitude to you for reading all my explanations and tips.<br>
To show you just how grateful I am, I'm going to sing you a song! The song is called...<br>

Ahem...<br>

<br>
Tip #004: Closing this software<br>
<br>
Here's a useful tip.<br>
Press the HOME Button at any time to return to the HOME Menu.<br>
<br>
Tip #005: Write-protected SD Card<br>
<br>
Oh!<br>
It looks like your SD Card is write-protected.<br>
This means you can only use Nintendo 3DS Sound to listen to tracks stored on the SD Card. You can't save any recordings to it.<br>
Don't worry--simply turn the power off and move the write-protection switch to the unlocked position, and you'll be able to record to the SD Card.<br>
Phew! If only all problems were this easy to solve.<br>
<br>
Tip #006: Let's get started!<br>
<br>
Thanks for putting some music on your SD Card.<br>
(If someone else put the music on for you, could you tell them thanks for me?)<br>
If you ever want to hear more about Nintendo 3DS Sound, just tap me with the stylus.<br>
<br>
Tip #007: Using the SD Card<br>
<br>
Turn off your Nintendo 3DS system before removing the SD Card.<br>
Open the slot cover and push the SD Card until it clicks.<br>
Remove the SD Card by pulling the part sticking out of the slot.<br>
When inserting an SD Card, make sure that it is oriented correctly.<br>
The connectors should be facing up.<br>
<br>
Tip #008: Recording guidance<br>
<br>
If you've tried recording but your voice seemed a bit quiet,<br>
try facing the speech bubble and talking.<br>
The microphone is located close to the Touch Screen.<br>
<br>
Tip #009: The parroting parakeet<br>
<br>
Everyone knows what parakeets are famous for, right? That's right: mimicking other sounds.<br>
Sometimes, I just get the urge to repeat things that I've overheard or recordings you've saved.<br>
I'm afraid I just can't help myself, so do take care not to say anything embarrassing about me.<br>
<br>
Tip #010: Playing with voices<br>
<br>
I'm sure you're keen to play around with voice recordings, aren't you?<br>
Just tap this icon to get started.<br>
Oh, and if you keep tapping the icon, you'll get different effects.<br>
<br>
Tip #011: Magic words: Code<br>
<br>
Do you know what "woodnetninn" means?<br>
It's a word you can only understand by recording yourself saying it and listening to the recording.<br>
Hmm, what could it be?<br>
<br>
Tip #012: Tricks: Autorecording<br>
<br>
You can start a recording automatically by facing the speech bubble and speaking loudly.<br>
Handy, isn't it? Or should I say... hands free. Chirp!<br>
<br>

<br>
Try tapping the Parakeet icon while listening to a voice recording.<br>
It'll sound just like me! Chirp, chirp! And more birds in the world can't be a bad thing! Chirp!<br>
<br>

<br>
You can play sounds by pressing L or R! It's what I call LR Percussion. There are a variety of different instruments.<br>
Play in time with the music and feel the beat!<br>
Tap the button icons to change the instrument.<br>
<br>
Tip #015: Parakeet chat: Walks<br>
<br>
When I'm out for a stroll, I like to sing.<br>
If I come across someone while walking around, my first impulse is to stop my musical chirping.<br>
But instead I tend to raise my voice and keep on singing louder than before.<br>
After all, I wouldn't want the people to think I'm embarrassed to be heard singing in public...even though I am.<br>
...I'm sure I'm not the only one who does this.<br>
<br>
Tip #016: Visualizers<br>
<br>
Have you noticed the images on the upper screen that change as the music plays?<br>
It's called a "visualizer."<br>
That's such a cool name. It sounds like an action-movie hero. "The Visualizer!"<br>
<br>
Tip #017: Change the visualizer<br>
<br>
You can change the visualizer on the upper screen while listening to music, you know.<br>
Just tap the pull cord.<br>
Find a visualizer you like and enjoy! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #018: Play folders<br>
<br>
The playback mode plays all the tracks in a folder in order and then stops.<br>
I put songs totaling about 30 minutes in a folder together...<br>

This way, I don't need to use a timer.<br>
<br>
Tip #019: Change speed and pitch<br>
<br>
Tap this icon...<br>
then slide the stylus around the Touch Screen to change the speed and pitch of the track you're listening to.<br>
Pitch is on the vertical axis,<br>
and speed on the horizontal.<br>
You'll be amazed at how different songs can sound when you play around with these settings. Chhhhhiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrpppp...<br>
<br>
Tip #020: Parakeet chat: Your voice<br>
<br>
Have you ever listened to a recording of your own voice and thought it sounded like someone completely different?<br>
There's a reason for this. When you hear your voice normally, you're actually hearing two things at once.<br>
One is the voice others hear, transmitted through the air. The other is the sound transmitted inside your head as you speak.<br>
When you hear a recording of your voice, you're hearing it without the sound inside your head.<br>
That's why it sounds so unfamiliar to you, but not to others.<br>
I prefer the way my voice sounds inside my head, to be honest. Chirp.<br>
<br>
Tip #021: Ideas: Phrases<br>
<br>
Why not try recording a message for a family member to greet them when they come back home? "Welcome home!"<br>
<br>
Tip #022: Magic phrase 1<br>
<br>
Have you ever heard the magic phrase "snare feed stem"?<br>
It's a phrase that can help you when you meet new people. How do you use this phrase? Simple!<br>

My answer is, of course, a resounding "Yes, let's!"<br>
<br>

<br>
Turn on the Robot effect while listening to a voice recording.<br>
YOUR. VOICE. WILL. SOUND. RATHER. MECHANICAL. Ahem. Robot parakeets sound like this: CHIRP.<br>
<br>
Tip #024: Overwriting recordings<br>
<br>
When editing voice recordings,<br>
you can overwrite the original recording by selecting Save.<br>
Try applying an effect, saving your changes, then applying another effect on top. The result should be interesting. Chirp!<br>
If you want to keep the original voice recording as well as the edited version,<br>
make sure that you copy it beforehand.<br>
<br>
Tip #025: Autoplay<br>
<br>
Have you ever listened to music on Autoplay?<br>
Here's an insider secret: it's actually me choosing the songs for you!<br>
What? You'd guess as much? Well, did you know that anytime you listen to music here...<br>
...I listen too.<br>
The more I listen to your music with you, the better I'll get at choosing songs for you in Autoplay. It's a rewarding job!<br>
<br>
Tip #026: 3D depth<br>
<br>

simply move the 3D depth slider up or down as required.<br>
<br>
Tip #027: Effects: Radio<br>
<br>
Tap this icon to activate the Radio effect on the track you're listening to.<br>
Doesn't that warm, retro sound bring you back to the days before digital?<br>
Even with all these newfangled ways of listening to any song, anytime, anywhere...<br>
...the ol' radio still has a certain magic to it. It was wireless before wireless was cool! Chirp!<br>
<br>

<br>
You can press Left to go the previous song and Right to skip to the next song.<br>
<br>
Tip #029: Your data is safe!<br>
<br>
With Nintendo 3DS Sound, you can play with music in all kinds of ways.<br>
And there's no need to worry: the original music data on the SD Card isn't changed.<br>
Relax, and have fun playing with your music.<br>
<br>
Tip #030: Control Tips: A<br>
<br>
By pressing A, you can confirm selections.<br>
But did you know you can also use it to play and pause?<br>
<br>
Tip #031: Change voice pitch<br>
<br>
Have you tried playing around with the pitch of voice recordings?<br>
You can make boys sound like girls and girls sound like boys. The results can be quite hilarious!<br>
You can also put on a high-pitched voice when recording and then lower the pitch to get a slightly weird version of your normal voice.<br>
<br>
Tip #032: Page colors<br>
<br>
Up to 18 recordings can be stored per page (screen).<br>
The recordings on the dark-colored page are stored to the System Memory.<br>
Those on the light-colored pages are saved to the SD Card.<br>
<br>
Tip #033: Magic phrase 2<br>
<br>
Have you ever heard the magic phrase "snowshare lootard knock"? It's a phrase you can use when someone you know has had some good news.<br>
How do you use this phrase? Simple! Just record yourself saying "snowshare lootard knock" and listen to the recording in reverse.<br>
The trick is not to pause between each word. Pretend it's just one word, all crammed together.<br>
Play back your recording and listen closely. What does it sound like to you?<br>
<br>
Tip #034: Voices: Helium<br>
<br>
Try tapping the Helium icon while listening to a voice recording.<br>
Your voice will sound high-pitched, like you were a tiny insect. "Help meeeeeee!"<br>
<br>
Tip #035: Ideas: Messages<br>
<br>
Why not commemorate a graduation or wedding by gathering a collection of recorded greetings from different people?<br>
<br>
Tip #036: Copy/move recordings<br>
<br>
Want to move a voice recording to a different on-screen slot?<br>
Just touch Move, then tap and slide the recording to move it wherever you want.<br>
If you tap Copy instead of Move,<br>
you can copy a voice recording to a different location using the same technique.<br>
Try touching and sliding any voice recordings that you want to copy.<br>
<br>
Tip #037: Move data over pages<br>
<br>
If you want to move some voice recordings to another page,<br>
just tap and hold the stylus on the icon for the recording you want to move,<br>
then slide it over the button you'd normally tap to change pages.<br>
<br>
Tip #038: Adding to playlists 1<br>
<br>
Select some music, then tap the Add... button.<br>
You can add music to a playlist this way.<br>
<br>
Tip #039: Removing from playlists<br>
<br>
If you remove a song from a playlist,<br>
the original song data won't get deleted from the SD Card.<br>
So relax, and feel free to remove songs from playlists!<br>
<br>
Tip #040: Deleting playlists<br>
<br>
What's that? You don't know how to erase a playlist?<br>
Sorry! I completely forgot to tell you.<br>
Open the playlist you want to erase, and remove all the songs.<br>
The playlist itself will disappear once the last song is removed.<br>
Don't worry, though. The music on the SD Card won't be lost when you do this.<br>
I had to erase one of my playlists when I realized that the songs in it didn't go together at all. My musical credibility was at stake! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #041: Using headphones<br>
<br>
If you're using headphones,<br>
you can still listen to music even with the system closed.<br>
This is quite handy for when you want to listen to music while you're out and about.<br>
But keep in mind that if you keep the system closed all the time, we won't get to see each other. I might get lonely, you know... Chirp.<br>
<br>
Tip #042: Control Tips: Up and down<br>
<br>
You can press Up or Down to change between different visualizers.<br>
<br>
Tip #043: Repeat folders<br>
<br>
This playback mode plays all the tracks in a folder in order, in a repeated loop.<br>
I tend to listen to my latest favorite songs over and over again, so I find this handy.<br>
Do you do the same thing? Put new songs into your daily rotation and listen over and over?<br>
Or do you prefer to listen to new songs less often, so you don't overdo it?<br>
<br>
Tip #044: LR Percussion: Off<br>
<br>
You may have noticed that there's an option for the LR Percussion instruments that doesn't actually play any noise.<br>
What could that be there for? Well...<br>

Whenever I'm feeling down, Chirpy Tunes never fails to perk me up! Chirp! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #046: Resume<br>

<br>
Tip #049: Cutting out parts<br>
<br>
In this playback mode...<br>
...you can slide the A and B markers to the start anf end of the part you want to hear, and it'll be repeated on a loop.<br>

<br>
I'll show you how to make your own magic phrases that can be heard only in reverse.<br>
Try recording yourself saying a word normally and then listening to it played in reverse.<br>
Let's use "hello" as an example. Play this word in reverse,<br>
and it sounds something like "wha-luh."<br>
This is the word you need to say in order to get "hello" when you play it in reverse.<br>
Try it out! Instead of following the reversed spelling, use the sounds that were in the original word, like the "luh" sound at the end of "wha-luh."<br>
What do you think it will sound like?<br>
The reverse of a reversed sound should sound like the original.<br>
It's obvious when you think about it, but give it a shot!<br>
<br>
Tip #051: Control Tips: Control Pad<br>
<br>
When playing a recording, you can use Control Pad to select a different recording.<br>
<br>
Tip #052: Voices: Transceiver<br>
<br>
Try tapping the Transceiver icon while listening to a voice recording.<br>
It'll sound all tinny, like a voice from a walkie talkie. "Come in, base! The parakeet has landed! Over!"<br>
<br>
Tip #053: Parakeet chat: Say "ah"<br>
<br>
When driving down a bumpy road,<br>
have you ever wanted to open your mouth and go "aaaaaaahhhh"?<br>
It's great fun making your voice shake like that.<br>
Or is it just me?<br>
<br>
Tip #054: Interface Color<br>
<br>
If you feel like a change, select Interface Color in Settings to give Nintendo 3DS Sound a new look.<br>
Not sure which color to go for? Just give the selection cursor a flick and leave it up to luck.<br>
Select Reset to return to the original color.<br>
<br>
Tip #055: Adding to playlists 2<br>
<br>
If you select a folder, then tap the Add... button,<br>
you can add all of the music in that folder to a playlist at once.<br>
<br>
Tip #056: Settings: Tap Sound<br>
<br>
Are the tapping sound effects getting in the way of your tunes?<br>
You can turn them off in Settings and enjoy the music as it was meant to be heard!<br>
<br>
Tip #057: Shuffle<br>
<br>
This playback mode shuffles all the tracks in a folder and plays them back in a loop.<br>
Shuffling up songs like this is a good way to keep your music collection sounding fresh.<br>
It's also fun trying to guess which song is going to be played next. I get it right once in a while.<br>
Do you think I might be psychic? Chirp.<br>
<br>
Tip #058: Language study drills<br>
<br>
If you can get used to listening to language lessons or practice recordings at higher speeds than the original,<br>
you'll find that they're easier to understand when you put them back to normal speed.<br>
You can adjust the speed from 0.5x (half speed)...<br>
...all the way up to 2x (double speed).<br>
I listen to my Feline-study recordings at 1.5x speed, and I'm making great strides in comprehension.<br>
<br>
Tip #059: LR Percussion: Coin<br>
<br>
One of the LR Percussion instrument types plays that famous coin sound.<br>
Once I play it, I just can't stop. Bling! Bling! Bling! Chirp.<br>
<br>
Tip #060: Parakeet chat: Karaoke<br>
<br>
I just love singing karaoke alone.<br>
It's great. I can dance and belt out the classics without worrying about what other people think.<br>
I can even practice somgs that I'd be embarrassed to sing badly in front of others.<br>
I also write up a list of what I want to sing in advance.<br>
After all, I don't want to waste time worrying about what to put on next.<br>
Chirp. I bet solo karaoke is a lot more complicated than you thought, eh?<br>
<br>
Tip #061: Recording-icon colors<br>
<br>
When saving a recording, you can choose a color for it.<br>
You know that nice, colorful OK button? Just tap the color on it that you want to use for your recording.<br>
Me, I like to use red for my voice and green for my friends.<br>
And orange?<br>
Well, that's for... Never mind. Chirp.<br>
<br>
Tip #062: Parakeet gig<br>
<br>
A pair of parakeets are putting on another show somewhere today.<br>
Music? Drama? Stand-up comedy? Well, they're a very multitalented pair,<br>
though no one's seen them before.<br>
They're always practicing in secret.<br>
<br>
Tip #063: Voices: Tunnel<br>
<br>
Try tapping the Tunnel icon while listening to a voice recording.<br>
The sound will echo. I can't be the only one who gets the urge to sing and whistle in places that echo, like stairwells. Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #064: Creating magic words 1<br>
<br>
Here's a way to make your own magic words.<br>
Let's try it with "thank you."<br>
We want to make a word that will sound like "thank you" when played backward, right?<br>
Let's start by writing it out backward, without any spaces: Uoyknaht<br>
You might have to listen a few times. Try to figure out how to write out what you're hearing. What does it sound like? "Ooik nat"?<br>
That should get you close, but you'll want to experiment until you get the magic phrase sounding just right.<br>
The key to perfecting it is to record your attempts and play them in reverse to see if they sound right.<br>
Get other people to record them, too. Different accents can have quite an effect on the results.<br>
<br>
Tip #065: Deleting groups of data<br>
<br>
If you want to erase multiple recordings at once, there's a way.<br>
Go to Settings, and then Data Management.<br>
You can erase one page of recordings at a time or erase the whole lot at once.<br>
<br>
Tip #066: Pressing L and R<br>
<br>
The instruments you play with LR Percussion have some hidden depth.<br>
Some of them make a different sound depending on how you play them.<br>
It's all in the length of the button press. A short press or a long press? Try it.<br>
<br>
Tip #067: Playlists: Top Ten<br>
<br>
You know, I think you can tell a bit about a person's personality based on his or her taste in music.<br>
Why not take a look at your friends' Top Ten lists? You might be surprised by a hidden side of theirs.<br>
I'd love to show you my own Top Ten list...<br>
But, well... I'm a bit embarrassed by what's on there. Chirp.<br>
<br>
Tip #068: Shuffle All<br>
<br>
You can leave song selection completely up to me if you like.<br>
Just select Autoplay, then Shuffle All. I'll do the rest!<br>
I'll play your songs all shuffled up and out of order. It's a fun way to listen!<br>
<br>
Tip #069: Keep-up visualizer<br>
<br>
Have you seen the Keep-up visualizer?<br>
Here's a tip: you can control the game using the Circle Pad.<br>
See how long you can keep the ball in the air! Chirp!<br>
Olé, olé-olé-olé!<br>
<br>
Tip #070: Playlists: StreetPass<br>
<br>
You might be aware of this already, but...<br>
if you use StreetPass, the system will exchange information about songs in your StreetPass playlist with other systems.<br>
Will you use the StreetPass playlist to show off, fit on, or just be yourself?<br>
Well, that's up to you.<br>
<br>
Tip #071: Voices: High Harmony<br>
<br>
Turn on the High Harmony effect while listening to a voice recording.<br>
Your voice will sound as light and airy as a hummingbird!<br>
<br>
Tip #072: Ideas: Reminders<br>
<br>
If you suddenly think up a great melody, record it before you forget it!<br>
<br>
Tip #073: Voices: Synth Harmony<br>
<br>
Try activating the Synth Harmony effect while listening to a voice recording.<br>
One voice will sound like a three-part harmony.<br>
Two voices will sound like a six-part harmony.<br>
Ten voices will sound like... Well, you get the point, I suppose.<br>
<br>
Tip #074: Creating magic words 3<br>
<br>
Here's a hint on making magic words.<br>
Try to use words that start with a vowel.<br>
"Alligator" "Arugula" "Onomatopoeia" (Just kidding! Chirp!) "Elegant"<br>
This will make it easier to pronounce the words backward.<br>
<br>
Tip #075: Voices: Low Harmony<br>
<br>
Turn on the Low Harmony effect while listening to a voice recording.<br>
You'll sound like some kind of mythical creature! A giant, or maybe a genie?<br>
<br>
Tip #077: Adding to playlists 3<br>
<br>
Here's a way to create a playlist.<br>
Select a theme from Autoplay, then tap the Add... button.<br>
The songs I chose for the theme will be added to any playlist you choose.<br>
<br>
Tip #078: Repeat a part<br>
<br>
This playback mode lets you listen to one section of a track repeatedly.<br>
Slide the A and B markers to the start and end of the part you want to hear.<br>
You could listen to part of a language lesson repeatedly until you've got the hang of a tricky phrase.<br>
I'm currently studying Feline so that I can communicate with cats and get them to stop bullying me. Meow!<br>
<br>
Tip #079: Effects: Instrumental<br>
<br>
Try tapping the Instrumental icon while listening to a song.<br>
The song's vocal elements will be reduced in volume. Perfect for some karaoke practice!<br>
<br>
Tip #080: Settings: Audio Output<br>
<br>
It's easy to change the audio-output mode in Nintendo 3DS Sound.<br>
Go to Settings, then Audio Output.<br>
You can choose from Surround, Stereo, or Mono sound.<br>
Stereo is like listening to a performance in front of you.<br>
Surround is more like being...well, surrounded by the sound! Chirp!<br>
<br>
Tip #081: The key to super singing<br>
<br>
Have you tried to sing a song, only to find that it was in too high a key to sing well?<br>
If so, why not use the pitch-adjustment tool and see if it helps put it in your singing range?<br>
Use Up or Down for precise adjustments in half-tone intervals.<br>
I used to stick to the original key, but now I adjust songs down so that I can finally sing them properly!<br>
After all, being able to sing it is the important thing, right? Chirp.<br>
<br>
Tip #082: The blue parakeet<br>
<br>
Have you ever seen my friend, the blue parakeet?<br>
He's got all kinds of interesting things to say, you know.<br>
If you see him, give him a tap.<br>
I'm such a great friend!<br>
<br>
Tip #083: Repeat a song<br>
<br>
This playback mode plays one track in a loop.<br>
This is good for when you want to learn a new song.<br>
I try to stay on top of the latest hits so that I can show off my skills. Karaoke, anyone?<br>
<br>
Tip #084: Control Tips: X and Y<br>
<br>
Press X or Y to change the current LR Percussion instrument.<br>
<br>
Tip #085: LR Percussion: Animal<br>
<br>
Try the bark and meow LR Percussion instruments.<br>
Meow and bark with the rhythm and you might make some furry friends.<br>
I don't really get on with cats, mind you. Chirp...<br>
<br>
Tip #086: Starting StreetPass<br>
<br>
Here's how to start StreetPass.<br>
First, tap StreetPass.<br>
Next, turn StreetPass on.<br>
Oh, and don't forget to make sure that wireless communication is on. If it isn't, give the wireless switch a push.<br>
Why not try heading out now, with your music in hand?<br>
<br>
Tip #088: Compatibility<br>
<br>
Let me tell you about the Compatibility list.<br>
It uses the song data you've exchanged over StreetPass to determine how compatibile you are with users you pass by.<br>
You know, they say that for each person in the world, there are 99 other people who have the exact same taste in music.<br>
True story. Chirp. I would never make up a fact like that! ...Chirp...<br>
<br>
Tip #089: Hit Parade<br>
<br>
Let me tell you about the Hit Parade.<br>
Basically, I gather song information recieved via StreetPass to create a chart of the most popular songs.<br>
You pass by all kinds of different people in town...<br>
I wonder what kinds of songs and artists they're all listening to?<br>
<br>
Tip #091: Playlists: Secret<br>
<br>
If you have some songs which titles you don't want people to see while you're listening,<br>
add them to your Secret playlist.<br>
The titles will be hidden. For example, "Secret Song" would be displayed as "SXXXXXXXXXX".<br>
No matter how uncool the song, you can tell me. I promise not to judge your taste in music. ...No? Oh well.<br>
<br>

I'd like to tell you a bit about the Nintendo 2DS system...<br>
First off, 3D images cannot be viewed on the Nintendo 2DS...<br>
But don't worry--you can still use all of your Nintendo 3DS software. They'll simply run in 2D.<br>
Sleep Mode is a good way to take a break or to use StreetPass, and it helps the battery last longer.<br>
Move the sleep switch to the right to enable Sleep Mode.<br>
Sometimes, you'll need to turn off wireless communication, like if you're on a plane.<br>
