 <h1>Nintendo 3DS Camera Usage Tips:</h1><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #001: Welcome!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Nintendo 2DS Version:</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Welcome to Nintendo 3DS Camera!<br><br>
 In Nintendo 3DS Camera, you can take 3D and 2D photos and videos.<br><br>
 Please remember that this system can display only 2D images. However, your images are stored on an SD Card...<br><br>
 So even though you can't view photos and videos in 3D on this system, you can transfer the files to a Nintendo 3DS or other compatible device.<br><br>
 Additionally, references to 3D in this application refer to the viewing of photos and videos on a Nintendo 3DS.<br><br>
 When taking photos and videos, try to position the system at least 12 inches from the subject of the shot.<br><br>
 I've got lots more useful information to share about Nintendo 3DS Camera. Just give me a tap at any time to hear some tips!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Nintendo 3DS Version:</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Welcome to Nintendo 3DS Camera!<br><br>
 In Nintendo 3DS Camera, you can take 3D and 2D photos and videos.<br><br>
 When taking 3D photos and videos and videos, make sure the 3D depth slider is up so you can view them in 3D.<br><br>
 Try to position the system at least 12 inches from the subject of the shot.<br><br>
 I've got lots more useful information to share about Nintendo 3DS Camera. Just give me a tap at any time to hear some tips!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #002: Reviewing the Usage Tips</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you found my little tips and hints useful? I hope so!<br><br>
 You can review any of the tips I've already given you by selecting Usage Tips in Settings.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #003: Taking a break</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Why not take a short break?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #004: Closing this software</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Here's a useful hint.<br><br>
 Press the HOME Button at any time to return to the HOME Menu.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #005: Write-protected SD Card</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Oh!<br><br>
 It looks like your SD Card is write-protected.<br><br>
 In this state, this SD Card can't be used with Nintendo 3DS Camera.<br><br>
 Don't worry, though. All you need to do is to turn the power off and move the write-protection switch to the unlocked position as shown above.<br><br>
 Phew! If only all problems were this easy to solve.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #006: Photo cameos</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Are you having fun taking 3D photos? Well, let me share something even more fun with you...<br><br>
 Photos in Nintendo 3DS Camera can show up in other games automatically! They might be modified, too. Exciting stuff, eh?<br><br>
 Don't worry, though. Your originals will be kept safe and sound with me. Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #007: Shoot from 12 inches</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have your 3D shots of objects like toys or teddy bears been turning out well?<br><br>
 If not, you might have the camera positioned too close to he subject.<br><br>
 It's like touching your nose with your finger. Instead of one finger, you see two blurred fingers, right?<br><br>
 The same principle applies when taking shots in Nintendo 3DS Camera.<br><br>
 Try to keep the system at least 12 inches away from the subject for the best results.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #008: Inner and outer cameras</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>The inner canera takes 2D shots.<br><br>
 The outer cameras take shots that can be viewed in both 3D and 2D.<br><br>
 If you want to take a photo of yourself in 3D, use the time function and the outer cameras!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #009: The red lever</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>I bet that red lever down there has piqued your curiosity. Have you tried tapping it yet?<br><br>
 If you tap it, new tools will come into view.<br><br>
 They'll allow you to change the camera mode and adjust the focus,<br><br>
 set a shutter time for photos,<br><br>
 and use speci shooting modes for videos.<br><br>
 Touch the tool lever again to deactivate and hide the tools.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #010: Adjusting 3D focus</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If other people find it hard to see your 3D photos and videos properly,<br><br>
 use the Circle Pad to adjust the 3D focus.<br><br>
 It will be easier to see shots in 3D if you line up the two seperate images so that they overlap each other.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #011: 3D focus</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Chirp! Do you have a moment?<br><br>
 3D shots are focused automatically. This is called 3D autofocus.<br><br>
 You can also adjust the 3D focus manually.<br><br>
 Move the left and right until the two images you want to focus on overlap.<br><br>
 To return to 3D autofocus, press X, or use the tool lever to hide the arrows.<br><br>
 That's all I wanted to tell you. Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #012: Ideas: People</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You've probably already done this, but taking photos of your friends and family is great fun.<br><br>
 I'm sure they'll enjoy checking your photos of them, too! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #013: Pro: Backgrounds</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you want to make the subject of your shot stand out, think about the background.<br><br>
 Using simple backgrounds, such as plain walls, will ensure that the subject is the star of your shot.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #014: Sparkle</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>The Sparkle effect is an easy (and glamorous!) way to decorate photos.<br><br>
 Simply aim the camera at a face, blow on the mic, and whoosh! It's like fairyland.<br><br>
 Time your photo carefully, and... Click!<br><br>
 You'll find Sparkle in the Camera Mode menu.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #015: Photo/video menus</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you tap an already selected thumbnail (the one with the red border), a small menu will appear.<br><br>
 Using this menu, you can add graffiti to photos and edit videos.<br><br>
 You can also use this menu to delete individual photos and videos.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #017: The little birdie that can</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>I may be a parakeet, but I'm no birdbrain.<br><br>
 I always know when to say the right thing.<br><br>
 Whether you're taking photos and videos or viewing them,<br><br>
 just give me a tap with the stylus to hear what I have to say.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #018: Tricks: Quick switching</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Did you know you can press Y to switch between taking and viewing photos and videos?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #019: 3D effect</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Taken a photo or video using the outer cameras, but it's not appearing in 3D?<br><br>
 Check that the 3D depth slider isn't down!<br><br>
 If you still aren't getting 3D images after moving the 3D depth slider up,<br><br>
 3D images may be restricted by Parental Controls. Kids, ask a parent or legal guardian about this. Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #020: Ideas: Outdoors</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you can't think of anything to take a shot of, why not take a walk?<br><br>
 You're sure to find some interesting subjects.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #021: 3D shots: Near and far</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>A road leading into the distance... A tree in the foreground with a building behind it... A hand raised toward the camera...<br><br>
 Capturing objects both near and far in the same scene can make sure a great 3D shot.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #022: Mystery</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>The Mystery effect is...well, mysterious! There's no preview, so you have to take a photo to see what you get.<br><br>
 You can take all kinds of photos with Mystery, and you might make some new discoveries.<br><br>
 They say that some Mystery photos even show things from other dimensions...</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #023: Trivia: The word "camera"</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Here's an interesting bit of trivia for you.<br><br>
 Did you know that the word camera comes from the Latin word for vaulted room? Chirp!<br><br>
 That's odd, don't you think? Why would we use a word that meant "room" for a device that takes photographs?<br><br>
 ...<br><br>
 Um... I'll find out and let you know! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #024: View more/fewer shots</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can change the number of photos or vireos shown on the lower screen by tapping the + or - icons.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #025: Pro: Neutral shots</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Portraits are all well and good, but why not try taking a shot from an angle, with the subject looking away from the camera?<br><br>
 You might get a more natural, lifelike result.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #026: Interface Color</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you feel like a change, select Interface Color in Settings to give Nintendo 3DS Camera a new look.<br><br>
 Not sure which color to go for? Just give the selection cursor a flick and leave it up to luck.<br><br>
 Select Reset to return to the original color.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #027: 3D shots: Jumble</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Thin objects and groups of differently sized and shaped objects look good in 3D shots.<br><br>
 How neat is your room?<br><br>
 If it's a mess, it might make for a good 3D shot!<br><br>
 Do tidy up, though.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #028: Merge</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>The Merge effect can produce some weird and wonderful photos-and get some funny reactions at your friends...<br><br>
 "I've seen people like this!"<br><br>
 "I think I look good in your hair!"<br><br>
 "Who on earth is that?!"<br><br>
 Me and the other parakeets have had a lot of fun with it. You're sure to have a laugh as well!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #029: Manual Controls</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Why not try setting up your own original camera effects?<br><br>
 There are four different settings you can change freely in Manual Controls.<br><br>
 You can return the settings to their original values by tapping Reset, so feel free to tinker with them as much as you like!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #030: Manual Controls + Merge</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You may not realize it, but whenever you use the Merge effect, I'm working hard behind the scenes.<br><br>
 If I can't find any faces, then I can't merge them for you.<br><br>
 If you're taking the photo in a dark place, or use the Negative or Solarize film types in Manual Controls,<br><br>
 it makes it really, really hard for me to make out faces.<br><br>
 I do try my best, though! Just...go easy on me if I make a mistake. I've got eyes like a parakeet, not like a hawk.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #031: Tricks: Shoot buttons</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can take photos while choosing the camera mode. Press L, R, or A.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #032: Attention Sound</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Try using the "bark" or "meow" attention sound when taking shots of your cat or dog.<br><br>
 It might turn to look at the camera at just the right moment for a great snap!<br><br>
 You could also use these sounds to get a smile out of babies and children, or anyone else you're taking a shot of!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #033: Pro: Different viewpoints</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Images of children or pets taken from a low angle can make for some interesting shots. Try changing your viewpoint, and see what it does for your work!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #034: Dream</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>For a beautiful portrait shot, try using the Dream effect.<br><br>
 Photos taken with this effect have a lovely, soft atmosphere.<br><br>
 Food will also look like it's steaming hot and delicious!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #035: Film</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Let me tell you about the types of film available in Manual Controls.<br><br>
 Each film type gives your shots a different atmosphere.<br><br>
 Try using the B/W film. It's like stepping onto the set of a silent movie!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #036: Pro: Camera shake</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Do you ever find your photos and videos turn out rather blurry?<br><br>
 If your hands move while you're taking a shot, it'll cause that blurring effect. This is what's known as camera shake.<br><br>
 Incidentally, photos are much more likely to suffer from camera shake when shooting in dark places.<br><br>
 When doing so, try to hold the system as steadily as you can, or place it on a steady surface.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #037: Thumbnail border colors</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Thumbnails for photos saved to the System Memory have dark borders,<br><br>
 and thumbnails for photos saved to the SD Card have light borders.<br><br>
 Is there anything I don't know?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #038: Trivia: Dark rooms</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>I found out why we use camera, a word that means room in Latin, to refer to a device that is used for taking photographs.<br><br>
 Many years ago, people discovered that if you make a small hole in the wall of a completely darkened room,<br><br>
 sunlight shining through the hole projects an image of the view outside onto the opposite wall!<br><br>
 Camera is the short form of the phrase camera obscura, which means "darkened room."<br><br>
 What? Rooms are too big to carry around and take photos with?<br><br>
 ...<br><br>
 Let me get back to you again on how they got from a room to a pocket-sized camera... Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #039: Removing the SD Card</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Turn off your Nintendo 3DS system before removing the SD Card.<br><br>
 Open the slot cover and push the SD Card in until it clicks.<br><br>
 Then, remove the SD Card by pulling the part sticking out of the slot.<br><br>
 When inserting an SD Card, make sure that the connectors are facing up.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #040: Pro: Keep snapping!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Even the pros don't always get the shot they want on the first try. They take lots of shots and choose the best one.<br><br>
 One of the keys to getting a good shot is just to take as many as you can!<br><br>
 You can always just delete the bad shots and keep the good ones. You might even end up with a great shot you didn't mean to take!<br><br>
 So if you're not sure of the right timing to take a shot, just snap, snap, snap, and sort them out later!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #041: Viewing slide shows</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Slide shows are a fun way of viewing and sharing your photos and videos.<br><br>
 If you're going to put the system down or view the slide show from a distance (or if several people will be viewing it). I recommend that you view it in 2D.<br><br>
 To view it in 2D, move the 3D depth slider down.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #042: Slide show: Themes</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can choose different themes for slide shows.<br><br>
 I'll do the legwork for you and pick out the right shots for each theme.<br><br>
 If the shots I pick don't quite match the theme, well... I do try my best.<br><br>
 Sorry. Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #043: Photo Save Location</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Photos taken with Nintendo 3DS Camera<br><br>
 can be saved to the System Memory or an SD Card.<br><br>
 You can store a maximum of about 380 photos to the System Memory,<br><br>
 and a maximum of about 3,000 photos and videos to an SD Card.<br><br>
 Select Photo Save Location in Settings to select where to save photos.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #044: JPG and MPO files</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Photos saved to the SD Card can be found in the DCIM folder.<br><br>
 There are two different file formats used for photos taken with Nintendo 3DS Camera.<br><br>
 Files whose names look like HNI_XXX.JPG are 2D photos.<br><br>
 Files whose names look like HNI_XXX.MPO are 3D photos.<br><br>
 The other day, a friend of mine accidentally deleted an MPO file.<br><br>
 The 3D data was lost, so the photo could be viewed only in 2D. He was pretty upset about it.<br><br>
 Learn from my...I mean, my friend's...mistake! Be careful not to delete important files! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #045: Ideas: Animals</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Why not try taking shots of dogs in town or pigeons in the park?<br><br>
 With a photo, you can add graffiti to express what the dog's thinking... Why, you might be able to make up a little story about it.<br><br>
 "Ruff! Now where did I put that bone?"</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #046: 3D shots: Framing</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>To ensure the best 3D effect, frame the subject of your shot so that it fits fully within the frame without being cropped.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #047: Viewing 3D shots</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you ever tried to take a photo or video in 3D and discovered later that the 3D slider was all the way down?<br><br>
 Don't worry! You can still view your shots in 3D by moving the 3D depth slider up.<br><br>
 Of course, any photos you take with the inner camera will remain in 2D no matter what. Use the outer cameras to take 3D shots.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #048: The 3D icon</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>A 3D icon is displayed on the upper screen while an image that can be shown in 3D is on the screen.<br><br>
 If the icon is white, the image is being displayed in 3D.<br><br>
 If the icon is gray, the image is being displayed in 2D.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #049: Timer</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Want to get in the frame for a group shot?<br><br>
 Try using the timer feature.<br><br>
 You can set a countdown, after which the system will shoot for you.<br><br>
 You can also use the voice-activation function to take a shot when you say "OK!"<br><br>
 Remember to say it loud and clear! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #050: Pro: Avoid camera shake</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Ever had the camera move ever so slightly right when you press the Shoot buttons?<br><br>
 The timer is pretty helpful for times when it's easy to get camera shake as you take a photo, like when shooting in dark rooms.<br><br>
 Just set the timer, then hold the system firmly in your hands.<br><br>
 You won't have to press the Shoot buttons this way, which could help prevent movement that causes camera shake.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #051: Low Light</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>The Low Light effect can help you when taking shots at night or in darker rooms.<br><br>
 It increases the exposure time slightly in order to capture more light,<br><br>
 so, to avoid camera shake, make sure you hold the camera firmly when shooting!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #052: 3D autofocus</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>3D autofocus is where I take care of focusing the image for you, behind the scenes.<br><br>
 The thing is, sometimes I can't tell what to focus on. For example, photos taken in dark places are difficult for me to work with. Chirp...<br><br>
 If you find that the image on the upper screen isn't appearing properly in 3D,<br><br>
 help me by adjusting the 3D focus yourself.<br><br>
 Just touch the red tool level to display the adjustment icon.<br><br>
 I'll still try to help as much as possible, but sometimes, I'll need you to do your part. What a great photo-taking team we'll make! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #053: Slide shows</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Slide shows are more fun if you choose music that suits your visuals.<br><br>
 You can choose from a variety of different music tracks in the slide-show settings.<br><br>
 You can also set the photo-display duration and transition effect.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #054: Trivia: Portable cameras</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>I've been looking into the development of cameras from darkened rooms to the handheld devices we use today.<br><br>
 It seems some very clever people figured out how to use lenses and mirrors to reproduce the darkened-room effect in a small box!<br><br>
 Awfully clever, don't you think? I hope that answers your questions.<br><br>
 Oh, hang on... A small box? But then how would we fit in there to actually see the picture?<br><br>
 ...<br><br>
 Hm. Looks like I've got a little research left to do.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #055: Ideas: Flowers</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you tried taking shots of flowers or plants?<br><br>
 You could try taking a shot of the same flower every day to record its growth.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #056: Pro: Backlight</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>A light source facing toward the camera is known as a backlight.<br><br>
 Taking a photo with a backlight will make the subject look darker.<br><br>
 This is undesirable in some situations but can also be used to create an interesting silhouette effect.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #057: 3D shots: Transparency</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Fences, windows, and other things you can see through make for interesting 3D shots.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #058: Brightness + Dream</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Manual Controls can be used to give Camera Mode effects a little more "oomph."<br><br>
 For example, try turning on the Dream effect amd moving the Brightness slider to the right.<br><br>
 You'll get a bright, blissful photo!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #059: Contrast</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you tried adjusting the Contrast setting in Manual Controls?<br><br>
 The setting lets you adjust the range of colors.<br><br>
 Move the slider to the left for a calmer range of colors.<br><br>
 Move the slider to the right for a brighter and more vivid range of colors.<br><br>
 When taking shots at special events and parties, try using a vivid contrast setting!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #060: Ideas: Sky</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Why not try taking a shot of the sky?<br><br>
 You might think you see the same sky every day, but every day gives it a new look.<br><br>
 Blue skies, like the sea... Floating, fluffy clouds... Passing airplanes...<br><br>
 (Don't take shots of the sun, though!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #061: 3D shots: Haze</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Even hazy bodies like steam or smoke can look good in 3D shots.<br><br>
 Just be careful that you don't get too close to anything hot!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #062: Displaying the level</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Press Down to display a level on the 3D Screen.<br><br>
 Press Down again to hide it.<br><br>
 You can also calibrate the red horizontal level in order to change its angle.<br><br>
 Place the system on a surface sloped to the angle that you wish to use for the level, then hold Up.<br><br>
 To return the baseline to normal, place the system on a table or other flat surface, then hold Up.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #063: Try using the level!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Need help keeping trees, buildings, and the like lined up straight in your shots? Press Down to display a handy level.<br><br>
 The red horizon line tilts as you tilt the system. It's roughly parallel with the ground.<br><br>
 The static white crosshairs indicate the center of the shot.<br><br>
 Use these to help you shoot straight!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #064: About the Merge effect</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You don't have to take photos of actual people when merging faces.<br><br>
 Try merging your face with people in posters, photos, or even with mannequins!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #065: Trivia: The first photos</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>OK. OK. I've finally sorted it all out. When you have a portable camera, you need a way for people to see the image being projected inside the camera, right?<br><br>
 Well, I'll skip the technical bits, but basically, the image is burned onto a strip of film inside the box that can be developed to produce a photograph!<br><br>
 Ah, the power of science!<br><br>
 I'm not fielding any more questions on this subject. Chirp.<br><br>
 (Feel free to do your own research into the subject, though! We've barely even scratched the surface!)</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #066: Ideas: Food</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Why not try taking a shot of today's dinner?<br><br>
 You could even take shots of your meals every day to keep a diary of what you eat.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #067: About the Sparkle effect</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you tilt the system while using the Sparkle effect. you can change the way the sparkles move.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #068: Grouping shots</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Version 1</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Do you have so many photos and videos that it takes a while to scroll through them?<br><br>
 Tap a date folder to select it, and then tap again to collapse all shots from that date into the folder, making scrolling easier.<br><br>
 Tap the collapsed folder if you want to see all of the shots again.<br><br>
 I went to a seed festival yesterday, but I'm not showing you the photos. Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Version 2</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Do you have so many photos and videos that it takes a while to scroll through them?<br><br>
 Tap a date folder to select it, and then tap again to collapse all shots from that date into the folder, making scrolling easier.<br><br>
 Tap the collapsed folder if you want to see all of the shots again.<br><br>
 I went to a seed festival yesterday. Would you like to see the photos? No? Too seedy for you? Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #069: Keep practicing!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Be sure to take a good look at your photos and videos once you take them.<br><br>
 Looking over the results can help you improve your technique.<br><br>
 You may even find inspiration!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #070: Pro: Balance</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Taking a shot of an object so that it appears right in the middle of the screen can give your work some real impact.<br><br>
 Alternatively, taking a shot so that it's slightly off center can give it a kind of cool look as well.<br><br>
 Press Down to display the level. It'll help you find the center of the screen.<br><br>
 Keeping the center of the screen in mind can help you balance the composition of your shots.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #071: Sharpness</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you tried adjusting the Sharpness setting in Manual Controls?<br><br>
 The setting lets you adjust how sharp the focus is.<br><br>
 Move the slider to the left, and you'll get a soft focus.<br><br>
 Move it to the right, and the focus will get sharper and sharper.<br><br>
 Using a softer focus can be a handy trick for taking more flattening shots of people.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #072: 3D shots: Vertical lines</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Including vertical lines, such as doors or pillars, in your 3D shots will enhance the 3D effect.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #073: Sepia + Sparkle</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Try combining different settings in Camera Mode and Manual Controls.<br><br>
 For example, if you try combining Sepia film with the Sparkle effect...<br><br>
 the Sparkle effect you know and love will come to be even more magical.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #074: Pinhole</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can use the Pinhole effect to give your photos an old-fashioned, nostalgic look.<br><br>
 Why not try using it to take a photo of a beloved old toy before you pass it on?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #075: Brightness</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you tried adjusting the Brightness setting in Manual Controls?<br><br>
 This setting lets you adjust the... Well, it lets you adjust the brightness of the shot. Chirp.<br><br>
 Move the slider to the left to go darker;<br><br>
 move it to the right to go brighter.<br><br>
 Master the settings in Manual Controls, and you may learn to take shots exactly the way you want them.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #076: Pro: Viewpoint</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>When taking shots of people, keep your viewpoint in mind.<br><br>
 For example, if you have a person facing right on the right-hand side of the shot, it'll look a bit cramped.<br><br>
 If you put them on the left-hand side of the slide, they'll fit in a bit more comfortably.<br><br>
 And for people facing left, the opposite applies. Put them on the right slide.<br><br>
 Balancing different things in the shot like this is called composition.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #077: B/W + Merge</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Try changing the Film setting in Manual Controls to B/W and combining it with the Merge effect...<br><br>
 Ta-da! You've got a photo of a famous figure right out of a history book!<br><br>
 (...But just who is it supposed to be a photo of, though?)</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #078: Ideas: After the rain</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you ever taken shots just after the rain stops?<br><br>
 It's a chance to take shots that you can't take when the weather's dry.<br><br>
 For instance, how about shooting a scene reflected in a puddle?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #079: Contrast + Pinhole</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You know which Manual Controls setting I like to combine with the Pinhole effect?<br><br>
 Contrast. Simply move the slider all the way to the right...<br><br>
 and it's just like using a toy camera!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #080: Pro: Angles</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>There are many differrmt ways to take portraits, depending on how you want to present the subject. For example...<br><br>
 Shoot from a low angle looking upward at the subject for a cool shot, like something from a fashion magazine.<br><br>
 Shoot from above with the subject looking up at you to increase the cuteness factor.<br><br>
 Even with the same subject and setting, the results can change dramatically when you use different angles.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #081: Trivia: A strange dream</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>I heard a story about someone living a long time ago who had a very strange dream.<br><br>
 The person dreamed of a man holding a small box with a lens on the front who drew a picture that looked just like the person dreaming all of this.<br><br>
 This all happened way before the invention of the camera.<br><br>
 Isn't that a strange story?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #082: Ideas: Favorites</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You'll always enjoy looking at shots of things you like or enjoy.<br><br>
 Your favorite people, places, belongings... Show how much you like them by takng shots of them!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #083: Video save location</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Videos you shoot with Nintendo 3DS Camera are always saved to the SD Card. They can't be saved to the System Memory.<br><br>
 So, as you might expect, the Photo Save Location setting is for photos only. It won't affect where your videos are saved. Keep that in mind. Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #084: Switching cameras</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You've probably worked this out by now, but you can use Nintendo 3DS Camera to take both photos and videos!<br><br>
 When you want to shoot a video, just tap the Video icon.<br><br>
 When you want to swap from shooting videos to taking photos, tap the Photo icon to switch modes.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #085: 3D shots: Videos</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Videos that contain a lot of movement might be difficult to see in 3D or might make you feel a bit dizzy to watch.<br><br>
 If you move the system around when you're filming, it's better to do so slowly.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #086: Special shooting modes</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can shoot some unusual videos using the special shooting modes.<br><br>
 Interval, Stop Motion, and Montage are all worth a try...<br><br>
 Each one lets you do something different, and they're all easy to use.<br><br>
 Oh, just one thing: none of these modes allows you to record sound with your video.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #087: Stop Motion</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>With Stop Motion, you can shoot simple animated videos.<br><br>
 For instance, you could take a handy nearby object, like a pen,<br><br>
 and shoot it while moving it ever so slightly between frames.<br><br>
 The resulting video will have a charming staccato quality that I, for one, am a huge fan of!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #088: Interval</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Interval shoots individual frames at set intervals, then puts them together into a single video.<br><br>
 This is an easy way to create videos in which it looks as though time has sped up.<br><br>
 Try shooting something that normally moves slowly, and you might end up seeing it in a totally different way!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #089: Montage</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Montage allows you to pause recording.<br><br>
 You can use this mode to shoot a single video that includes a variety of different scenes.<br><br>
 Just pause recording, pick your new scene, and then unpause to start recording again!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #090: Watching videos</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Video thumbnails have borders that are a bit different from the borders used for photos.<br><br>
 Touch the thumbnail for a video, and it will play on the upper screen.<br><br>
 That way you'll remember in no time what kind of video it was that you shot. Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #091: Something different</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you been making good use of the special shooting modes?<br><br>
 Use them to take totally different kinds of videos from normal. It's really quite good fun! Chirp!<br><br>
 To find the special shooting modes, just tap the red lever at the bottom of the screen.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #092: Ideas: Dancing dolls</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can make dolls dance by using Stop Motion.<br><br>
 Pose them and move them little by little while taking a frame at a time.<br><br>
 It's so exciting to imagine how the finished video will look as you make fine adjustments!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #093: Tricks: Afterimages</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you noticed a kind of afterimage appearing when you film using the special shooting modes?<br><br>
 With Interval and Stop Motion, this image shows you the last frame that was shot.<br><br>
 With Montage, this inage shows you the frame at which you paused the recording.<br><br>
 These images help you make sure that your next shot in the sequence lines up with your last one!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #094: Ideas: Clouds</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Try using Interval to film clouds as they drift across the sky.<br><br>
 Set the interval to five seconds, and you'll be able to capture the motion of the clouds really well.<br><br>
 Set a longer interval than that for dramatic scenes where the clouds seem to whizz past!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #095: Pro: Blown-out highlights</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Do you ever find that clouds up in the sky are too bright in your photos and videos to show much detail?<br><br>
 In photography, this phenomenon is known as a blown-out highlight.<br><br>
 Move the Brightness slider in Manual Controls to the left to compensate for this.<br><br>
 That should help bring out detail when you're shooting bright things like clouds!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #096: Ideas: Transformation</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you given Montage a try yet?<br><br>
 I got my cousin to help me, and we made a video in which I change into a superhero!<br><br>
 It's easier than it sounds! Montage lets us pause the recording, I put on my costume, then we started filming again!<br><br>
 You should have seen me in my cape. I looked so heroic! Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #097: Editing videos</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>With the Edit Video tools, you can do a lot of really neat things with your videos as you play them.<br><br>
 You can change the playback speed and pitch, for example.<br><br>
 The horizontal axis controls the speed at which the video is played,<br><br>
 while the vertical axis controls the pitch of the sound.<br><br>
 You can even play your videos backward! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #098: Ideas: Plant growth</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Wouldn't it be great to be able to watch a flower as it starts to bloom, or a new shoot emerging from the ground?<br><br>
 If you set the interval to 60 seconds in Interval and film flowers and plants,<br><br>
 you'll be able to watch their growth sped up! You can record up to about eight days of footage this way.<br><br>
 Not a bad idea for budding filmmakers. Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #099: Slide-show media types</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you want a slide show to skip videos and only show photos,<br><br>
 select Media Type in the Select Theme menu and choose the Photos Only option.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #100: Stop Motion + B/W</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Be sure to try applying different camera settings to the three special shooting modes. You can get some very interesting results!<br><br>
 For example, if you use Stop Motion and film in black and white,<br><br>
 you can create a video that looks just like an old silent movie.<br><br>
 How dramatic! Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #101: Ideas: People watching</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Here's a fun idea: set your Nintendo 3DS system up over a view of a busy stret junction,<br><br>
 then shoot an Interval video with the interval set to two seconds.<br><br>
 Watching the people and cars rush by has a certain epic quality to it, doesn't it?<br><br>
 Oh, the busy pace of modern life! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #102: Tricks: Frame by frame</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Spot something in a video that only appears for a second? Take a proper look by using Edit Video.<br><br>
 Just pause the video after you see something you want to check out, then press L to back up a frame at a time.<br><br>
 If you go too far back, just press R to advance a frame at a time.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #103: Saving frames</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>The Save Frame option in the Edit Video menu allows you to pick out single frames from your videos.<br><br>
 Tap Save Frame when a video is paused to save the image on the upper screen as a photo.<br><br>
 That way you'll able to save those crucial moments and view them to your heart's content!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #104: Tricks: Interval animation</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Do you find that shooting in Stop Motion is fun, but it's too bothersome for your liking?<br><br>
 If so, then you might prefer Interval, which takes the individual shots you're going to string together automatically!<br><br>
 Prop your Nintendo 3DS system up so it will shoot the right area, then start filming, and you can have both hands free to shift objets between shots!<br><br>
 Once you get the hang of it, set the interval to two seconds for a very speedy shooting session!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #105: Ideas: Construction</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Building models is fun, isn't it?<br><br>
 You know what's even more fun? Shooting the model-building process using Interval or Stop Motion!<br><br>
 Watching yourself progress from a pile of pieces to a finished model makes you realize how rewarding model building is!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #106: Visible area of photos</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>A photo you've taken with Nintendo 3DS Camera is actually bigger than what's visible on screen.<br><br>
 To see the whole thing, slide the Circle Pad down.<br><br>
 To return to normal view, slide the Circle Pad up.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #107: Nintendo DSi software</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Some Nintendo DSi software titles use photos saved to the System Memory.<br><br>
 There are some photos that they can't use though, like ones with graffiti drawn on them.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #108: Ideas: Teleportation</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Psst... Want to know the secret of teleportation?<br><br>
 Put a cup on a table and start shooting a video in Montage mode.<br><br>
 Shoot the cup sitting on the table for a couple of minutes, then pause, move the cup, and resume filming.<br><br>
 Ta-da!<br><br>
 It's magic! Real magic! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #109: AVI files</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Videos saved to the SD Card can be found in its DCIM folder.<br><br>
 Files with names like HNI_XXXX.AVI are videos.<br><br>
 Please don't try to play 3D videos on devices that don't support 3D playback.<br><br>
 It won't work! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #110: "The Noble Parakeet"</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Allow me to express my gratitude to you for reading all my explanations and tips.<br><br>
 To show you just how grateful I am, I'm going to sing you a song! The song is called...<br><br>
 ..."The Noble Parakeet."<br><br>
 Ahem...<br><br>
 Cough... Chirp...<br><br>
 ...Actually, maybe I'll save that for next time. I hope you keep having fun shooting photos and videos! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <h1>Nintendo 3DS Sound Usage Tips:</h1><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #001: Welcome!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Welcome to Nintendo 3DS Sound!<br><br>
 Here, you can have fun playing music and recording sounds.<br><br>
 You can adjust the volume using the volume control.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #002: Reviewing usage tips</p><br>

 You can review any of the tips I've already given you by selecting Usage Tips in Settings.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #003: Take a break</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Why not take a short break?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #004: Closing this software</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Here's a useful tip.<br><br>
 Press the HOME Button at any time to return to the HOME Menu.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #005: Write-protected SD Card</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Oh!<br><br>
 It looks like your SD Card is write-protected.<br><br>
 This means you can only use Nintendo 3DS Sound to listen to tracks stored on the SD Card. You can't save any recordings to it.<br><br>
 Don't worry--simply turn the power off and move the write-protection switch to the unlocked position, and you'll be able to record to the SD Card.<br><br>
 Phew! If only all problems were this easy to solve.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #006: Let's get started!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Thanks for putting some music on your SD Card.<br><br>
 (If someone else put the music on for you, could you tell them thanks for me?)<br><br>
 If you ever want to hear more about Nintendo 3DS Sound, just tap me with the stylus.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #007: Using the SD Card</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Turn off your Nintendo 3DS system before removing the SD Card.<br><br>
 Open the slot cover and push the SD Card until it clicks.<br><br>
 Remove the SD Card by pulling the part sticking out of the slot.<br><br>
 When inserting an SD Card, make sure that it is oriented correctly.<br><br>
 The connectors should be facing up.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #008: Recording guidance</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you've tried recording but your voice seemed a bit quiet,<br><br>
 try facing the speech bubble and talking.<br><br>
 The microphone is located close to the Touch Screen.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #009: The parroting parakeet</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Everyone knows what parakeets are famous for, right? That's right: mimicking other sounds.<br><br>
 Sometimes, I just get the urge to repeat things that I've overheard or recordings you've saved.<br><br>
 I'm afraid I just can't help myself, so do take care not to say anything embarrassing about me.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #010: Playing with voices</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>I'm sure you're keen to play around with voice recordings, aren't you?<br><br>
 Just tap this icon to get started.<br><br>
 Oh, and if you keep tapping the icon, you'll get different effects.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #011: Magic words: Code</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Do you know what "woodnetninn" means?<br><br>
 It's a word you can only understand by recording yourself saying it and listening to the recording.<br><br>
 Hmm, what could it be?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #012: Tricks: Autorecording</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can start a recording automatically by facing the speech bubble and speaking loudly.<br><br>
 Handy, isn't it? Or should I say... hands free. Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #013: Voices: Parakeet</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Try tapping the Parakeet icon while listening to a voice recording.<br><br>
 It'll sound just like me! Chirp, chirp! And more birds in the world can't be a bad thing! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #014: LR Percussion</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can play sounds by pressing L or R! It's what I call LR Percussion. There are a variety of different instruments.<br><br>
 Play in time with the music and feel the beat!<br><br>
 Tap the button icons to change the instrument.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #015: Parakeet chat: Walks</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>When I'm out for a stroll, I like to sing.<br><br>
 If I come across someone while walking around, my first impulse is to stop my musical chirping.<br><br>
 But instead I tend to raise my voice and keep on singing louder than before.<br><br>
 After all, I wouldn't want the people to think I'm embarrassed to be heard singing in public...even though I am.<br><br>
 ...I'm sure I'm not the only one who does this.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #016: Visualizers</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you noticed the images on the upper screen that change as the music plays?<br><br>
 It's called a "visualizer."<br><br>
 That's such a cool name. It sounds like an action-movie hero. "The Visualizer!"</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #017: Change the visualizer</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can change the visualizer on the upper screen while listening to music, you know.<br><br>
 Just tap the pull cord.<br><br>
 Find a visualizer you like and enjoy! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #018: Play folders</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>The playback mode plays all the tracks in a folder in order and then stops.<br><br>
 I put songs totaling about 30 minutes in a folder together...<br><br>
 ...and sweat my way through my daily workout! Chirp!<br><br>
 This way, I don't need to use a timer.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #019: Change speed and pitch</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tap this icon...<br><br>
 then slide the stylus around the Touch Screen to change the speed and pitch of the track you're listening to.<br><br>
 Pitch is on the vertical axis,<br><br>
 and speed on the horizontal.<br><br>
 You'll be amazed at how different songs can sound when you play around with these settings. Chhhhhiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrpppp...</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #020: Parakeet chat: Your voice</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you ever listened to a recording of your own voice and thought it sounded like someone completely different?<br><br>
 There's a reason for this. When you hear your voice normally, you're actually hearing two things at once.<br><br>
 One is the voice others hear, transmitted through the air. The other is the sound transmitted inside your head as you speak.<br><br>
 When you hear a recording of your voice, you're hearing it without the sound inside your head.<br><br>
 That's why it sounds so unfamiliar to you, but not to others.<br><br>
 I prefer the way my voice sounds inside my head, to be honest. Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #021: Ideas: Phrases</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Why not try recording a message for a family member to greet them when they come back home? "Welcome home!"</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #022: Magic phrase 1</p><br>

 It's a phrase that can help you when you meet new people. How do you use this phrase? Simple!<br><br>
 Just record yourself saying "snare feed stem," then listen to the recording in reverse.<br><br>
 My answer is, of course, a resounding "Yes, let's!"</p><br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <p>When editing voice recordings,<br><br>
 you can overwrite the original recording by selecting Save.<br><br>

 <br>
 <p>Tip #031: Change voice pitch</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you tried playing around with the pitch of voice recordings?<br><br>
 You can make boys sound like girls and girls sound like boys. The results can be quite hilarious!<br><br>
 You can also put on a high-pitched voice when recording and then lower the pitch to get a slightly weird version of your normal voice.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #032: Page colors</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Up to 18 recordings can be stored per page (screen).<br><br>
 The recordings on the dark-colored page are stored to the System Memory.<br><br>
 Those on the light-colored pages are saved to the SD Card.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #033: Magic phrase 2</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you ever heard the magic phrase "snowshare lootard knock"? It's a phrase you can use when someone you know has had some good news.<br><br>
 How do you use this phrase? Simple! Just record yourself saying "snowshare lootard knock" and listen to the recording in reverse.<br><br>

 <br>
 <p>Tip #035: Ideas: Messages</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Why not commemorate a graduation or wedding by gathering a collection of recorded greetings from different people?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #036: Copy/move recordings</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Want to move a voice recording to a different on-screen slot?<br><br>
 Just touch Move, then tap and slide the recording to move it wherever you want.<br><br>
 If you tap Copy instead of Move,<br><br>
 you can copy a voice recording to a different location using the same technique.<br><br>
 Try touching and sliding any voice recordings that you want to copy.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #037: Move data over pages</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you want to move some voice recordings to another page,<br><br>
 just tap and hold the stylus on the icon for the recording you want to move,<br><br>
 then slide it over the button you'd normally tap to change pages.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #038: Adding to playlists 1</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Select some music, then tap the Add... button.<br><br>
 You can add music to a playlist this way.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #039: Removing from playlists</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you remove a song from a playlist,<br><br>
 the original song data won't get deleted from the SD Card.<br><br>
 So relax, and feel free to remove songs from playlists!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #040: Deleting playlists</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>What's that? You don't know how to erase a playlist?<br><br>
 Sorry! I completely forgot to tell you.<br><br>
 Open the playlist you want to erase, and remove all the songs.<br><br>
 The playlist itself will disappear once the last song is removed.<br><br>
 Don't worry, though. The music on the SD Card won't be lost when you do this.<br><br>
 I had to erase one of my playlists when I realized that the songs in it didn't go together at all. My musical credibility was at stake! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #041: Using headphones</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you're using headphones,<br><br>
 you can still listen to music even with the system closed.<br><br>
 This is quite handy for when you want to listen to music while you're out and about.<br><br>
 But keep in mind that if you keep the system closed all the time, we won't get to see each other. I might get lonely, you know... Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #042: Control Tips: Up and down</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can press Up or Down to change between different visualizers.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #043: Repeat folders</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>This playback mode plays all the tracks in a folder in order, in a repeated loop.<br><br>
 I tend to listen to my latest favorite songs over and over again, so I find this handy.<br><br>
 Do you do the same thing? Put new songs into your daily rotation and listen over and over?<br><br>
 Or do you prefer to listen to new songs less often, so you don't overdo it?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #044: LR Percussion: Off</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You may have noticed that there's an option for the LR Percussion instruments that doesn't actually play any noise.<br><br>
 What could that be there for? Well...<br><br>
 Select it when listening to music with the system in your bag. The LR Percussion won't make a racket that way!<br><br>
 Even a soundless instrument has its uses, eh? Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #045: Creating a playlist</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you tried creating playlists?<br><br>
 Choose a song and select Add, then New to create a playlist.<br><br>
 You can name the playlist and change the icon.<br><br>
 I've made a playlist full of my favorite upbeat numbers and called it "Chirpy Tunes."<br><br>
 Whenever I'm feeling down, Chirpy Tunes never fails to perk me up! Chirp! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #046: Resume</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tap Resume to continue the last song you were listening to from the point where you left off.<br><br>
 It's handy when you've taken a break from listening to music to do some recordings.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #047: Control Tips: B</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>By pressing B, you can go back, close messages, and cancel.<br><br>
 But did you know you can also use it to reset the pitch and speed of recorded sounds?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #048: Voices: Fan</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>By listening to a recording with the Fan effect turned on,<br><br>
 you can make anyone into an alien.<br><br>
 "CHIRP! TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER!" Just like that.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #049: Cutting out parts</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>In this playback mode...<br><br>
 ...you can slide the A and B markers to the start anf end of the part you want to hear, and it'll be repeated on a loop.<br><br>
 If you then tap Save, the track will be cropped to only include the selection.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #050: Creating magic words 2</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>I'll show you how to make your own magic phrases that can be heard only in reverse.<br><br>
 Try recording yourself saying a word normally and then listening to it played in reverse.<br><br>
 Let's use "hello" as an example. Play this word in reverse,<br><br>
 and it sounds something like "wha-luh."<br><br>
 This is the word you need to say in order to get "hello" when you play it in reverse.<br><br>
 Try it out! Instead of following the reversed spelling, use the sounds that were in the original word, like the "luh" sound at the end of "wha-luh."<br><br>
 What do you think it will sound like?<br><br>
 The reverse of a reversed sound should sound like the original.<br><br>
 It's obvious when you think about it, but give it a shot!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #051: Control Tips: Control Pad</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>When playing a recording, you can use Control Pad to select a different recording.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #052: Voices: Transceiver</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Try tapping the Transceiver icon while listening to a voice recording.<br><br>
 It'll sound all tinny, like a voice from a walkie talkie. "Come in, base! The parakeet has landed! Over!"</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #053: Parakeet chat: Say "ah"</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>When driving down a bumpy road,<br><br>
 have you ever wanted to open your mouth and go "aaaaaaahhhh"?<br><br>
 It's great fun making your voice shake like that.<br><br>
 Or is it just me?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #054: Interface Color</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you feel like a change, select Interface Color in Settings to give Nintendo 3DS Sound a new look.<br><br>
 Not sure which color to go for? Just give the selection cursor a flick and leave it up to luck.<br><br>
 Select Reset to return to the original color.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #055: Adding to playlists 2</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you select a folder, then tap the Add... button,<br><br>
 you can add all of the music in that folder to a playlist at once.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #056: Settings: Tap Sound</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Are the tapping sound effects getting in the way of your tunes?<br><br>
 You can turn them off in Settings and enjoy the music as it was meant to be heard!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #057: Shuffle</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>This playback mode shuffles all the tracks in a folder and plays them back in a loop.<br><br>
 Shuffling up songs like this is a good way to keep your music collection sounding fresh.<br><br>
 It's also fun trying to guess which song is going to be played next. I get it right once in a while.<br><br>
 Do you think I might be psychic? Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #058: Language study drills</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you can get used to listening to language lessons or practice recordings at higher speeds than the original,<br><br>
 you'll find that they're easier to understand when you put them back to normal speed.<br><br>
 You can adjust the speed from 0.5x (half speed)...<br><br>
 ...all the way up to 2x (double speed).<br><br>
 I listen to my Feline-study recordings at 1.5x speed, and I'm making great strides in comprehension.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #059: LR Percussion: Coin</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>One of the LR Percussion instrument types plays that famous coin sound.<br><br>
 Once I play it, I just can't stop. Bling! Bling! Bling! Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #060: Parakeet chat: Karaoke</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>I just love singing karaoke alone.<br><br>
 It's great. I can dance and belt out the classics without worrying about what other people think.<br><br>
 I can even practice somgs that I'd be embarrassed to sing badly in front of others.<br><br>
 I also write up a list of what I want to sing in advance.<br><br>
 After all, I don't want to waste time worrying about what to put on next.<br><br>
 Chirp. I bet solo karaoke is a lot more complicated than you thought, eh?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #061: Recording-icon colors</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>When saving a recording, you can choose a color for it.<br><br>
 You know that nice, colorful OK button? Just tap the color on it that you want to use for your recording.<br><br>
 Me, I like to use red for my voice and green for my friends.<br><br>
 And orange?<br><br>
 Well, that's for... Never mind. Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #062: Parakeet gig</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>A pair of parakeets are putting on another show somewhere today.<br><br>
 Music? Drama? Stand-up comedy? Well, they're a very multitalented pair,<br><br>
 though no one's seen them before.<br><br>
 They're always practicing in secret.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #063: Voices: Tunnel</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Try tapping the Tunnel icon while listening to a voice recording.<br><br>
 The sound will echo. I can't be the only one who gets the urge to sing and whistle in places that echo, like stairwells. Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #064: Creating magic words 1</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Here's a way to make your own magic words.<br><br>
 Let's try it with "thank you."<br><br>
 We want to make a word that will sound like "thank you" when played backward, right?<br><br>
 Let's start by writing it out backward, without any spaces: Uoyknaht<br><br>
 You might have to listen a few times. Try to figure out how to write out what you're hearing. What does it sound like? "Ooik nat"?<br><br>
 That should get you close, but you'll want to experiment until you get the magic phrase sounding just right.<br><br>
 The key to perfecting it is to record your attempts and play them in reverse to see if they sound right.<br><br>
 Get other people to record them, too. Different accents can have quite an effect on the results.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #065: Deleting groups of data</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you want to erase multiple recordings at once, there's a way.<br><br>
 Go to Settings, and then Data Management.<br><br>
 You can erase one page of recordings at a time or erase the whole lot at once.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #066: Pressing L and R</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>The instruments you play with LR Percussion have some hidden depth.<br><br>
 Some of them make a different sound depending on how you play them.<br><br>
 It's all in the length of the button press. A short press or a long press? Try it.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #067: Playlists: Top Ten</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You know, I think you can tell a bit about a person's personality based on his or her taste in music.<br><br>
 Why not take a look at your friends' Top Ten lists? You might be surprised by a hidden side of theirs.<br><br>
 I'd love to show you my own Top Ten list...<br><br>
 But, well... I'm a bit embarrassed by what's on there. Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #068: Shuffle All</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can leave song selection completely up to me if you like.<br><br>
 Just select Autoplay, then Shuffle All. I'll do the rest!<br><br>
 I'll play your songs all shuffled up and out of order. It's a fun way to listen!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #069: Keep-up visualizer</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you seen the Keep-up visualizer?<br><br>
 Here's a tip: you can control the game using the Circle Pad.<br><br>
 See how long you can keep the ball in the air! Chirp!<br><br>
 Olé, olé-olé-olé!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #070: Playlists: StreetPass</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You might be aware of this already, but...<br><br>
 if you use StreetPass, the system will exchange information about songs in your StreetPass playlist with other systems.<br><br>
 Will you use the StreetPass playlist to show off, fit on, or just be yourself?<br><br>
 Well, that's up to you.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #071: Voices: High Harmony</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Turn on the High Harmony effect while listening to a voice recording.<br><br>
 Your voice will sound as light and airy as a hummingbird!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #072: Ideas: Reminders</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you suddenly think up a great melody, record it before you forget it!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #073: Voices: Synth Harmony</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Try activating the Synth Harmony effect while listening to a voice recording.<br><br>
 One voice will sound like a three-part harmony.<br><br>
 Two voices will sound like a six-part harmony.<br><br>
 Ten voices will sound like... Well, you get the point, I suppose.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #074: Creating magic words 3</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Here's a hint on making magic words.<br><br>
 Try to use words that start with a vowel.<br><br>
 "Alligator" "Arugula" "Onomatopoeia" (Just kidding! Chirp!) "Elegant"<br><br>
 This will make it easier to pronounce the words backward.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #075: Voices: Low Harmony</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Turn on the Low Harmony effect while listening to a voice recording.<br><br>
 You'll sound like some kind of mythical creature! A giant, or maybe a genie?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #077: Adding to playlists 3</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Here's a way to create a playlist.<br><br>
 Select a theme from Autoplay, then tap the Add... button.<br><br>
 The songs I chose for the theme will be added to any playlist you choose.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #078: Repeat a part</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>This playback mode lets you listen to one section of a track repeatedly.<br><br>
 Slide the A and B markers to the start and end of the part you want to hear.<br><br>
 You could listen to part of a language lesson repeatedly until you've got the hang of a tricky phrase.<br><br>
 I'm currently studying Feline so that I can communicate with cats and get them to stop bullying me. Meow!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #079: Effects: Instrumental</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Try tapping the Instrumental icon while listening to a song.<br><br>
 The song's vocal elements will be reduced in volume. Perfect for some karaoke practice!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #080: Settings: Audio Output</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>It's easy to change the audio-output mode in Nintendo 3DS Sound.<br><br>
 Go to Settings, then Audio Output.<br><br>
 You can choose from Surround, Stereo, or Mono sound.<br><br>
 Stereo is like listening to a performance in front of you.<br><br>
 Surround is more like being...well, surrounded by the sound! Chirp!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #081: The key to super singing</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you tried to sing a song, only to find that it was in too high a key to sing well?<br><br>
 If so, why not use the pitch-adjustment tool and see if it helps put it in your singing range?<br><br>
 Use Up or Down for precise adjustments in half-tone intervals.<br><br>
 I used to stick to the original key, but now I adjust songs down so that I can finally sing them properly!<br><br>
 After all, being able to sing it is the important thing, right? Chirp.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #082: The blue parakeet</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you ever seen my friend, the blue parakeet?<br><br>
 He's got all kinds of interesting things to say, you know.<br><br>
 If you see him, give him a tap.<br><br>
 I'm such a great friend!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #083: Repeat a song</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>This playback mode plays one track in a loop.<br><br>
 This is good for when you want to learn a new song.<br><br>
 I try to stay on top of the latest hits so that I can show off my skills. Karaoke, anyone?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #084: Control Tips: X and Y</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Press X or Y to change the current LR Percussion instrument.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #085: LR Percussion: Animal</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Try the bark and meow LR Percussion instruments.<br><br>
 Meow and bark with the rhythm and you might make some furry friends.<br><br>
 I don't really get on with cats, mind you. Chirp...</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #086: Starting StreetPass</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Here's how to start StreetPass.<br><br>
 First, tap StreetPass.<br><br>
 Next, turn StreetPass on.<br><br>
 Oh, and don't forget to make sure that wireless communication is on. If it isn't, give the wireless switch a push.<br><br>
 Why not try heading out now, with your music in hand?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #088: Compatibility</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Let me tell you about the Compatibility list.<br><br>
 It uses the song data you've exchanged over StreetPass to determine how compatibile you are with users you pass by.<br><br>
 You know, they say that for each person in the world, there are 99 other people who have the exact same taste in music.<br><br>
 True story. Chirp. I would never make up a fact like that! ...Chirp...</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #089: Hit Parade</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Let me tell you about the Hit Parade.<br><br>
 Basically, I gather song information recieved via StreetPass to create a chart of the most popular songs.<br><br>
 You pass by all kinds of different people in town...<br><br>
 I wonder what kinds of songs and artists they're all listening to?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #090: StreetPass at concerts!</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>My sister went to go and see The Birdies live the other day.<br><br>
 Her Hit Parade in Nintendo 3DS Sound was on fire!<br><br>
 Apparently, everyone there had put songs by The Birdies on their StreetPass playlists,<br><br>
 so when all the fans flocked together, even tracks from The Birdies' unlistenable third album shot up in the charts.<br><br>
 Incidentally, my sister's member number 002 in The Birdies' fan club. Chirp! Amazing, eh?</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Tip #091: Playlists: Secret</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you have some songs which titles you don't want people to see while you're listening,<br><br>
 add them to your Secret playlist.<br><br>
 The titles will be hidden. For example, "Secret Song" would be displayed as "SXXXXXXXXXX".<br><br>
 No matter how uncool the song, you can tell me. I promise not to judge your taste in music. ...No? Oh well.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Blue Parakeet:</p><br>

 <h1>Nintendo 2DS "About this System" Dialog:</h1><br>
 <br>
 <p>I'd like to tell you a bit about the Nintendo 2DS system...<br><br>
 First off, 3D images cannot be viewed on the Nintendo 2DS...<br><br>
 But don't worry--you can still use all of your Nintendo 3DS software. They'll simply run in 2D.<br><br>
 Sleep Mode is a good way to take a break or to use StreetPass, and it helps the battery last longer.<br><br>
 Move the sleep switch to the right to enable Sleep Mode.<br><br>
 Sometimes, you'll need to turn off wireless communication, like if you're on a plane.<br><br>
 Wireless communication can be toggled on and off via the icon in the top-left corner of the HOME Menu.<br><br>

 <br>
 <h1>News Channel Usage Tips:</h1><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can move around freely in some areas by holding the B Button and pressing Up or Down on the +Control Pad. The B Button is on the bottom of the Wii Remote.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>When you have a long article or a long list of headlines to read, press Up and Down on the +Control Pad to scroll up and down through the text.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>When + and - Button icons appear on a screen, pressing those buttons on your Wii Remote has the same effect as pointing at the icons and pressing the A Button.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can press Left or Right on the +Control Pad while reading an article or viewing a slide show to skip forward and back between different articles.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>When a photo accompanies a news article, you can point at the photo and press the A Button to see an enlarged version of the photo.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>When viewing the globe, press Up or Down on the +Control Pad to change your viewing angle.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If a particular portion of a news article catches your attention, you can highlight that section for others by holding down the 1 Button and pointing at that section to select the text.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>If you hold down the A Button and twist your Wii Remote while viewing the globe, you can change which way the globe faces. You can also do this on the Forecast Channel.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>With some buttons, you can press and hold them to get the same effect as pressing them many times.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>When viewing both the News Channel and the Forecast Channel, you can press your Wii Remote's HOME Button to view the Operations Guide for the channel you're viewing.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>Have you seen my younger sister on the Photo Channel? If you point at her and press the A Button, she'll teach you secrets about the Photo Channel... But my sister is pretty quick, so you may have trouble catching her.</p><br>
 <br>
 <p>You can press the 1 or 2 Button during a slide show to adjust how long articles are displayed.</p>
 <br>
 <h1>Photo Channel Usage Tips:</h1><br>
 <br>
 <p>In some areas, you can aim the pointer while holding the B Button to scroll around the screen. What's that? "Where's the B Button?" Hmm... I wonder...</p>
 <br>
 <p>When you have a lot of photos on your SD Card, you can press up and down on the +Control Pad to scroll through them.</p>
 <br>
 <p>When + and - icons appear on-screen, pressing the + and - Buttons on the Wii Remote is the same as highlighting those icons and pressing the A Button.</p>
 <br>
 <p>There is an easy way to move from a close-up of one photo to a close-up of the next: just press left or right on the +Control Pad.</p>
 <br>
 <p>If you aim your cursor at a photo and press up or down on the +Control Pad, something will happen around the cursor. I don't know what, though...</p>
 <br>
 <p>The 1 and 2 Buttons are quite useful when you're watching a movie.</p>
 <br>
 <p>You can set slide shows to your favorite music. It involves an SD Card... And a computer... And MP3 music files.</p>
 <br>
 <p>Sorry! You'll have to ask someone in the know. But slide shows are much cooler when you set them to your favorite songs.</p>
 <br>
 <p>Have you tried selecting the Brighten and Hard-Boiled mood changes multiple times in a row?</p>
 <br>
 <p>If you do a mood change to a movie file, the sound changes, too.</p>
 <br>
 <p>The scissors in Doodle can do more than just cut. Try pressing the 1 Button while you cut or after you've cut.</p>
 <br>
 <p>There's a simple way to create composite photos. First, use the scissors to cut a piece out of one photo. Then just move to the photo you want to paste that piece onto!</p>
 <br>
 <p>Try pressing down on the +Control Pad and selecting the eraser while doodling. This will undo some of your changes.</p>
 <br>
 <p>If you hold down the 1 Button when you choose the number of pieces in a puzzle, the screen will... And if you do it when you view records, it will also...</p>
 <br>
 <p>You can also try your hand at puzzles of movie files.</p>
 <br>
 <p>If you hold some buttons down, you might be able to scroll faster.</p>
 <br>
 <p>Press the + or - Buttons during a slide show to adjust the volume. You have more volume options with MP3 files than you do with the default music.</p>
