	addition, unauthorised persons may gain access to one or more
	Friends Lists or personal information that contain information about
	you or your friends without your knowledge.  Nintendo will not
	monitor use of or access to individual Friends Lists and it is your
	responsibility to monitor your interactions, and those of your
